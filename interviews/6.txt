Q: Thank you for joining me today, Pei Wangmen. I'm excited to learn about your experiences as a master's student and intern, helping Russian students study in China. It sounds like a fascinating role that bridges cultures and educational opportunities.
A: Thank you, Albek. It’s a pleasure to speak with you. My internship involves working closely with Russian students, helping them navigate the application process, settle in, and adapt to life in China. It's rewarding to see students overcome cultural and language barriers and thrive in their studies. The role requires a lot of patience, empathy, and cross- cultural understanding.
Q: That sounds challenging and fulfilling. What kind of support do you offer to these students, and what are the main challenges they face?
A: We provide comprehensive support, from application assistance to orientation sessions, cultural workshops, and ongoing academic and personal support. Many Russian students struggle initially with the language barrier, culture shock, and adapting to the fast-paced academic environment in China. We try to ease the transition by organizing mentorship programs, language exchange sessions, and cultural immersion activities. It’s crucial to build trust so students feel comfortable asking for help.
Q: That’s impressive. How does the work culture in China differ from Mongolia or Russia?
A: Chinese work culture places a strong emphasis on discipline, punctuality, and respect for hierarchy. The environment can be fast-paced, competitive, and driven by high expectations. In contrast, Mongolian culture emphasizes personal relationships and a more flexible approach, while Russian work culture tends to be more formal and structured. Understanding these differences is crucial for helping students adjust.
Q: Can you share an interesting or surprising experience from your work?
A: One memorable experience was when a group of Russian students organized a cultural showcase event. They cooked traditional dishes, performed dances, and even sang in Mandarin. The event was a huge success and helped bridge cultural gaps. It was heartwarming to see students embracing new experiences while proudly sharing their own culture.
Q: What qualities are important for success in your role?
A: Patience, adaptability, and cultural sensitivity are essential. Every student has unique challenges, and it’s important to listen carefully and respond with empathy. Being proactive and resourceful helps too, especially when unexpected issues arise. Effective communication is crucial for bridging cultural differences and providing clear guidance.
Q: How do Chinese students perceive Russian students, and are there any cultural misunderstandings?
A: Overall, Chinese students appreciate the friendliness and openness of Russian students. However, cultural misunderstandings can happen—sometimes due to
differences in communication styles. Chinese students often value indirect communication and subtlety, while Russians tend to be more direct. We address these issues by promoting cross-cultural understanding through workshops and discussions.
Q: What advice would you give Russian students coming to China?
A: Be open to new experiences and embrace the differences. Learning some Mandarin before arrival can make a huge difference. Patience and respect for local customs are also important—small gestures, like using chopsticks correctly or understanding cultural norms, are appreciated. Building friendships with local students can enrich the experience and make the adjustment smoother.
Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?
A: I love seeing students grow, adapt, and thrive. It’s fulfilling to help them navigate challenges and become more confident. Watching friendships form across cultures is incredibly rewarding. It reminds me of the importance of understanding and cooperation in today’s interconnected world. This role has taught me a lot about patience, empathy, and leadership.
Q: Thank you, Pei Wangmen! This has been an enlightening conversation.
A: Pei Wangmen: Thank you, Albek! I’m glad to share my experiences. It’s been wonderful discussing how cross-cultural understanding can create meaningful connections and opportunities.
