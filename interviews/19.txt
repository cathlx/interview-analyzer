Q: How do you understand that the job is being done well? (you achiving company's goals / you performing in the right direction)
A: I believe doing a job well means that my work not only meets the project requirements but also makes a meaningful impact on the company’s broader goals. For me, it's all about seeing the tangible results of our efforts—whether that's faster application performance, happier users, or a real boost in business growth. When I look back at my work, I see that if the end result has moved us closer to our targets, then I know we’re on the right track.
Q: What is the right way to make decision in your work?
A: When it comes to making decisions at work, I like to think of it as a team sport. I trust that the best choices come when we pool our knowledge, look at the data, and consider all the potential impacts. It’s not about one person calling all the shots—it’s about having a conversation with everyone involved so that the decision fits our long-term vision. I really enjoy working in an environment that values creativity, collaboration, and open communication. For instance, an ideal partner company or supplier is one that shares our passion for quality and innovation. And if I get a day off, my ideal vacation would be a mix of relaxing in nature, exploring cultural spots around Beijing, or even just a quiet day with a good book—anything that helps me recharge and come back with fresh ideas.
Q: Please describe your usual working day
A: A typical day for me starts around 9 AM with a quick stand-up meeting with the team, where we catch up on what everyone’s working on and set our priorities for the day. I then dive into coding, troubleshooting, or planning system designs, with plenty of opportunities to brainstorm with colleagues. My afternoons usually feature meetings with product managers or cross-functional teams, making sure that what we’re doing is aligned with our goals. At the end of the day, I take a moment to reflect on what we achieved and jot down ideas for tomorrow.
Q: Please describe your latest achievement (big or small) in your place of work (or previous place of work)
A: One achievement I’m really proud of is when I led a project to optimize our core application. By rethinking our caching strategy and fine-tuning our data queries, we managed to reduce response times by 30%. That improvement not only made the system more efficient but also gave users a smoother experience, which in turn gave our business a competitive edge.
Q: Please describe place of work A and B (previous and current, your and the one of partners etc.)
A: I’ve experienced two very different work cultures. In my previous job at a bustling startup I thrived on the fast-paced, ever-changing environment which taught me a lot about rapid problem-solving. Now, in my current role at a larger company I appreciate the more structured approach and the focus on long-term sustainable innovation. Both experiences have shaped me in different ways and taught me valuable lessons.
Q: Please describe what your company does in general terms with details but not sensitive ones
A: Overall, my company provides comprehensive IT solutions—from building and maintaining cloud infrastructures to data analytics and cybersecurity. We focus on helping businesses adapt and thrive in a digital world, ensuring that they remain competitive and secure in an ever-evolving technological landscape.
