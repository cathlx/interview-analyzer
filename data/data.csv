phrase,ref
"Alright, I'm alright, I'm alright.",mixed
What's up?,mixed
So I am a creative lead when it comes to content strategy and content generation and content marketing.,mixed
"I also do a lot of marketing services, digital marketing.",mixed
"I also do events, both BTL and ATL.",mixed
"When I say ATLI I mean campaigns, I run campaigns on digital mediums and in a BTLI do underground events, marketing campaigns, events and all of that.",mixed
"Also I mean sports management agency work, specifically football.",mixed
"These things, yes.",mixed
So basically my business is pursue my passion.,internal
So I'm passionate about them.,internal
I give it my 100%.,internal
I enjoy doing them.,internal
Wow.,mixed
"So yes, for marketing campaigns, for instance, I'll just limit it to marketing campaigns.",mixed
"So marketing campaigns, we have metrics, we have KPI, for instance, we measure the reach, we measure the experiential.",external
"So for instance, if you are talking digital marketing campaigns, you are talking about your reach, you are talking about the engagement you are able to generate online	and then you are also talking about the participation.",external
You know how many people participated the effectiveness of the campaign.,external
"So your KPI is basically would be centered around the participation, would be centered around the reach and then would also be centered around how much of the experience the people who who participated enjoyed.",external
"I mean, if you can have some sort of talkability around the campaign, you can't really gauge talkability.",mixed
But if you have 6 out of 10 people online talking about your campaign means you know you've achieved a particular goal.,external
"Well, yes, so my probationary Pro is basically was premised on my ability to deliver.",external
"And then also, you know, consistency in, in my excellence.",internal
"When I say excellence, I mean the, the, the kind of the quality of the, of the output you are given.",mixed
So I would also give you an example.,mixed
"For instance, during your probationary prod, you are asked to come up with a campaign for a particular product.",mixed
"OK, now you are supposed to get X amount of reactions or you're supposed to get X amount of sampling.",mixed
"If it's a BTO, you go on the ground, you sample the product, it's a new product you are bringing up, you are coming up to.",mixed
"So you are given X amount of sampling, you are given X amount of feedback you are supposed to generate and all of that.",mixed
"So during my probationary report, I was given targets to meet and then I was able to achieve them.",internal
"Without meeting these targets, I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to be retained as an employer.",mixed
So basically that's how my provisional product went.,mixed
"And then also my in office activities, how I was relating with my fellow workers.",mixed
"I mean, you could you could have the best output, you could have the best attitude towards your work, you could deliver the best result.",external
"But if you are not impacting or you are not generally given a good feeling in the office, you wouldn't really be retained.",external
"So yes, in as much as you are performing on the job, you also have to try as much as possible to make sure you are at peace with those you are working with, you are playing well in in the team and all of that.",external
"So yes, those are the some of the factors that.",mixed
"Well, I didn't mix.",mixed
"OK, so first of all, I understood that I was in the office for work and anybody I see around is a coworker or is there basically for work.",mixed
"OK, but I'm human and there are some traits, some good traits you'd like to learn from your supervisors.",external
So I kept it formal when I had to keep it formal.,mixed
And then I went in formal when you know the mood or the situation called for it.,internal
"For instance, I couldn't be formal when that the person was in a bad mood or the person had suffered a terrible loss.",external
I couldn't go formal.,mixed
OK.,mixed
"I had to be a bit sympathetic towards the situation and be a bit informal, go out of my way to offer some sort of sympathy to the person.",external
And then also there were happy times in their life that they would have loved to celebrate it.,mixed
I couldn't go formal.,mixed
"I couldn't say, Oh no, we are just coworkers.",mixed
I can't just see you in the office and let it go.,mixed
You had to reach out.,external
You had to try and be human.,external
"So yes, I did a mix of both the formal and the informal approaches to towards my supervisors, yeah.",internal
"Can't say you dislike, but I think sometimes it gets difficult.",internal
"Sometimes you get a brain drain, you get a creative block.",mixed
"You know, you need to come up with a new thing, you need to come up with a new strategy, you need to come up with a new concept.",internal
"And it seems you have exhausted all the creativity in your head, OK, And your clients are waiting, your bosses are waiting for the next wow factor.",external
"So sometimes you get very difficult trying to get inspiration, especially when you are locked up in an office and being a creative.",mixed
You need the environment to sort of give you some sort of inspiration.,external
"When you are locked up in an office, it becomes very difficult for you to get the inspiration.",external
"So I think that's, that's the only problem I have with my job.",internal
"Brain, brain, a brain block, a creative stall and all of that.",mixed
"That is the only problem aside that I enjoy everything that comes with the stress, the trail, the uncertainty is about campaign, how well would go and all of that.",internal
"It's, it's beautiful.",internal
"Well, like I mentioned it later on, it's basically my passion.",internal
So I'm just chasing a passion and then I'm just trying to make money out of it.,internal
"So I wasn't influenced by a person, Percy.",internal
"I was just influenced by my intrinsic motivation, what I wanted to do.",internal
"I sat down, did some sort some self introspection, and then I just decided to follow my passion and then try as much as possible to monetize it.",internal
"So yeah, I'm just inspired by myself and what I believe I can achieve in the creative space.",internal
"Man, of course.",mixed
"So I, I would always, you know, take you back to me being creative, being creative, you need to be as balanced as possible because you get inspired by the environment.",external
You get inspiration from the environment.,external
"So you never know where you could find the next inspiration, right?",external
So you try as much as possible to keep it balanced.,mixed
"You don't, you don't, you're not so much into the job, yes, as your passion.",mixed
"You're supposed to be serious about it, but you need to know when to take a break.",internal
"So I enjoy life with my family, my niece especially and my mum.",internal
I take breaks sometimes.,mixed
I sleep a lot as well.,mixed
"I spend time, I try to spend quality time with my family.",mixed
"I don't, I don't make my life all about work, work, work, work.",internal
"No, I balance it properly.",internal
I spend time with my family.,mixed
"I take them out sometimes, we have dinners sometimes, we take a walk sometimes, and we have sleep insurance.",mixed
Sometimes we all gather and then have fun and sleep.,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
So that's our balance.,mixed
My.,internal
"OK, so I believe as a team player that to each has to it his or her strength or her area of expertise, right?",internal
So I believe in team playing a lot.,internal
"And I believe that each person is blessed with, let me say superior knowledge or superior know how in particular areas of this space we found our ourselves in.",internal
So our decision making basically is generic - we make decisions as a team.,external
"OK, So I don't, I don't impose decisions on people.",mixed
I don't impose things on my fellow workers.,mixed
"We sit down, we have a conversation as a team.",mixed
We try to judge on so the judge on them.,mixed
"We try to figure out how best we can, you know, solve things or we can go about things.",mixed
And then we try as much as possible to also adopt best practices elsewhere.,mixed
"So like I said, people have superior knowledge or, or technical know how when it comes to some things.",external
I am not all knowing like I'm not all doing as well.,internal
I believe in delegating and delegating efficiently.,internal
So within the team there are people who are very competent with some things.,mixed
"We sit down, we pick their minds on particular areas of expertise and then we make a decision as a team.",external
"OK, so the idle work environment for us as creatives is not making people feel small in their box, making every person responsible for whichever activity he or she has been assigned to.",internal
"So for me as as a superior or as a boss, I try to make people boost their morale up every time have them, you know, conceive positive mindset towards each and every assignment	they are given.",mixed
"We also motivate staff who, you know, I found one thing in some areas, we also try to educate them.",mixed
We also try to empower them in a way.,mixed
So the atmosphere in this office or in this company is more of a +1 is you can do it kind of thing.,mixed
You can do it spirit and then teamwork.,mixed
So we do we solve problems as a team.,external
We have fun as a team.,mixed
We suffer as a team.,mixed
"We take hits and losses, though.",mixed
I'm the boss.,internal
"I take, you know, the major part of it, but that kind of what's it called the familial kind of thing, that kind of feeling that we have here.",mixed
"We, we approach everything as a team and as a family.",mixed
"So that is the kind of spirit we have here, the team spirit, team morale and then inspiring each other, challenging each other, positive, you know, healthy competition in here.",mixed
That's the kind of attitude.,mixed
We accept here or we have conceived in this company.,mixed
Wow.,mixed
"For me personally, are you asking for me personally?",internal
"Oh well, my again as a critic, my day starts when I feel there's for for instance, so when I feel there is a lot of things to do, I come into the office very early, sometimes at six AMI try to sign off what I need to sign off.",internal
I try to take meetings that I'm supposed to take and then I try to delegate each assignment to whoever I believe is the most competent.,internal
"OK, so that is normally how my day goes.",mixed
"If I do not have a lot of paperwork to do, I step out and then I try to supervise projects that have been done.",mixed
"I try to keep an eye on every project that has been done, for instance, like shoes, like campaigns, like events.",internal
I go around supervising and then making sure everything is in place.,mixed
"If there is no such thing, I just hit the playground with my children and then my nieces and then we have a good time and I also and treat my staff to take time off and then spend some time with family or spend some time doing what they enjoy doing.",mixed
"Well, my role for now, we won the best African film from the Cannes Digital awards.",mixed
"Cannes, I'm not sure.",mixed
I'm sure you know what Cannes says.,internal
Cannes is a film awarding scheme or whatever.,mixed
He based in France.,mixed
"So that's our latest award for a movie, a short film that we did based around tourism and then patriotism.",mixed
So that is our most recent award.,mixed
"But then we have, you know, gotten a couple of awards.",mixed
"I wouldn't say that to Brad, but we have got him quite a number of awards, which we are proud of as a team.",external
"We also look forward to, you know, raking in a few more awards just to feel good about ourselves.",external
What do you do?,mixed
We are creative agencies.,mixed
"So anything creative, I would say we are creative alchemist.",internal
OK.,mixed
"So anything when it comes to content generation like movies, like short films, like commercial TV commercials, like digital contents, when it comes to static graphics and then you know, moving graphics and all of that.",mixed
We also do a bit of advertising.,mixed
"We also do a bit of media buying, so radio media buying, TV media buying.",mixed
We do marketing as well.,mixed
We devise marketing strategy.,mixed
"We do marketing campaigns, we do marketing events as well.",mixed
"And then we also do sports management, so specifically in football agencies.",mixed
So we are licensed FIFA agents.,mixed
"If we sport the talent, we try to connect this talent with the best bid bidder just to you know, push the talent as far as this talent can go.",mixed
So this footballing talent can go.,mixed
So that is that is the scope of our business.,mixed
That is what we do here.,mixed
Right.,mixed
"So apprenticeship, I took time to be an apprentice.",mixed
I learned under the best that I know.,internal
I also understood time.,internal
I told myself that time edifies.,internal
"So if you put in the time diligently, you will reap some good success at the end of it.",internal
But I believe in apprenticeship and being mentored by people in whom you can find very positive traits.,internal
"So mentorship, apprenticeship and taking responsibility sometimes most of us really do not like to be held responsible, especially when things go South.",mixed
"But being responsible and learning how to take the hits, sometimes learning how to be points to what you are now kind of strengthens your character.",internal
So those are the three.,mixed
"I mean, those are the ones that stand out, you know, practices that I have employed my whole life and it has brought me where I am. Subjecting yourself to apprenticeship, understanding how time works, taking responsibility for everything.",internal
"And then, you know, cultivating a very positive attitude everywhere, every time, being optimistic in every situation.",internal
Yeah.,mixed
"OK, so I obviously have 24 hours like everyone else, but I have a way of going about my things.",internal
There's this theory that I used.,internal
Just hold on a SEC.,mixed
I want to show you that.,internal
Yeah.,mixed
"So basically what I do is I break my task into simpler ones, and then I try to take them off my schedule one at a time.",internal
"So for instance, if I know that I have so many meetings to take or I have so many things to accomplish, I take the easy ones.",mixed
I start with the easy ones.,mixed
Bit by bit I take them off my list.,mixed
"And then when I am quite ready, when I've had lunch and I feel strong, I tackle the most difficult one.",internal
So it's just breaking down your tasks into simple ones and then achieving them bit by bit?,mixed
"Bit by bit, yeah.",mixed
So that's how I manage my time.,internal
"Of course, of course, of course.",mixed
"OK, so first of all, in the creative space, the star is the sky is big enough for every star to shine.",mixed
"OK, you don't have to do what everybody's doing.",internal
You can be your own unique self and you can just find the unique selling proposition for yourself and then you do it.,internal
"Second of all, passion without work is bullshit.",internal
I'm sorry.,internal
"It's, it's nothing.",mixed
"So in as much as you're passionate about something, you need to understand that you need to work hard towards it, cultivate healthy working attitude towards it, cultivate a positive working attitude towards it.",internal
"And then thirdly, it's teamwork and networking.",mixed
So you need to be a very good team player.,internal
You need to respect and understand that people are well talented in things that you are not.,external
People can be better than you are at things and that's OK.,external
"You need to understand that people actually have an upper hand in some things that you do not have, and you have to try as much as possible to make them responsible for those things in order to push you.",internal
"OK, so you can, you know, go alone when you're alone.",internal
"But if you are in the team, you can go far and you can sustain properly.",mixed
"So yes, those are the things that I believe can be some sort of guiding principles for whoever wants to venture into this world.",internal
"Well, I think working smart the hard way is what works for you.",internal
"I mean, you can't outsmart everything in your life.",mixed
"Sometimes you need to put in the work, sometimes you need to be a fool and raise true challenges to hard work.",mixed
"But working smart also saves you a lot of time, which you can use to, you know, concentrate on other things.",mixed
"So I think a healthy blend of both, you know, you went to work hard on something and then you know, you went to work smart on something.",internal
"When you are able to blend both properly, I think you you'd achieve some, some sort of success.",internal
You do?,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
"Course, one thing I've learnt throughout my career is that communication ions out a lot of things and people who do not know how to communicate what they are thinking or how they feel often have issues in life.",internal
"So in my professional experience I have had, you know, sometimes where clients might have said they want this way, but it was communicated differently from their outfit.",mixed
"And we decided to go with their official communication and came out whoever is responsible, whoever is calling the shots didn't want it that way.",external
"So I have tried as much as possible to always ensure we all align on one particular direct in one particular direction, that communication is clear, we know what exactly we are doing.",mixed
"Secondly, like you mentioned, people management.",mixed
People management also makes you learn that everybody's coming from a different background.,external
People are coming from different people have different view viewpoints about life.,mixed
People have different views about work.,mixed
"People are coming from, you know, diverse places.",mixed
So you try as much as possible to accommodate them.,external
"And then I don't know if there's a right word, whip them in line towards the company vision and all of that.",external
"Because without the company, without the umbrella called company, you would never ever, I'm sure in your lifetime never meet those people.",mixed
So you try as much as possible to elevate the company's mission and vision above all personal experiences.,external
And then you chase the company's mission and vision.,external
There will be problems.,mixed
Obviously there'll be conflict.,mixed
We are human.,mixed
There'll be conflicts on one or two times.,mixed
"As a manager, I try as much as possible to be fair and to be just.",internal
"If you are wrong, I am going to tell you are wrong and you are going to suffer the consequences for being wrong.",internal
"If you are right, I'm going to tell you are right.",internal
"But all in all, I try as much as possible to make everybody understand that we are all going in one direction.",mixed
"We are all going in one direction and we have to relegate our personal feelings, our personal experiences, everything to the background and to that particular life.",external
"Books, I have quite a number.",mixed
I've read a lot of books.,mixed
"I don't really remember the titles, but I pick and, you know, I filter through some of the things that I can learn.",internal
But one outstanding one for me is it made it made a profound impact.,mixed
"It left a profound impression on me since the time I've read it, and I still read it today.",mixed
Even this morning I read it that for that.,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
I think it shapes your perspective of our life.,external
It helps you understand that people might come from the same background but might have different opinions about things.,external
People might be enjoying the same privileges but might have different opinions about life and different opinions about dreams and what is possible and what is not possible.,mixed
So which that product?,mixed
"Thank you, Sir.",mixed
Thank you so much.,mixed
Thanks for having me.,mixed
Enjoy your day.,mixed
"Hello, Ruizhou.",mixed
I'm Victoria.,mixed
I'm Korea citizen.,mixed
"I came to Russia to study and after that I just find work in some company, Aurora Technology.",mixed
Now I study and work at the same time.,mixed
"Well, I understand that it's being well done when all projects are submitted exactly on time and when clients are really satisfied.",external
"For example, our last project creating a website for a client was completed two weeks ahead of the schedule and the client even left us a great review.",external
"Once again, please.",mixed
How to make decisions?,external
Mostly through analysing all sort of data and of course taking feedback from our team into account.,external
"The last time we decided to which is purchasing campaign to launch, we really analysed all the previous campaigns and the team's opinions and choose the most promising option.",external
"You know this place where you can personally, you can be creative and work independently, just these.",internal
Ideal partner.,mixed
"They need to be reliable, you know, and have a good reputation on the market, of course, like our recent supplier of companies for production who always meets deadlines exactly and offers us furball terms.",external
Really comfortable guy to work with.,mixed
"About vacation, yeah, we mostly works five to two, you know, five day works to the day offs.",mixed
"Ideal, I just prefer not to work.",internal
It's ideal.,internal
Ideal one or what?.,mixed
"Well, my day starts with checking my plan for the day and they're having meetings with the team.",mixed
"When then I mostly work on the current task, like developing a new market strategy.",mixed
"For example, recently I'm doing this after lunch.",mixed
I usually meet with clients or partners and in the end I just prepared reports of the day's results.,mixed
"It was really interesting situation, really let me feel comfortable.",internal
"Recently, I successfully completed initiations with a new supplier and we were able to reduce production cost by 10%.",mixed
That's you know important for our profitability in this quarter.,mixed
So if you're so good.,mixed
"For now, I am working in a modern office right in the city center, which is comfortable to go there and there's a lot of lights, some modern stuff, enough space, that's all just comfortable situation.",mixed
"We have some special workspace and some special have rest space, so it's very comfortable.",mixed
"If you have some tough time, you need to have some mental rest.",internal
You just go to have rest.,mixed
Company develops software for financial institutions.,mixed
We create applications which that help banks and insurance companies to make the year operations and improve customer service.,mixed
"You know, for example, we recently launched a new app for mobile banking analysis analytics, and it's already being used by several major banks.",mixed
"Right now, I'm working in the department of the supplies of the gas project.",mixed
Yes.,mixed
Not really.,mixed
"My department is international, so my colleagues are pretty friendly.",mixed
I see key indicators.,external
"First, I meet targets set by my supervisors, such as ensuring timely delivery of supplies and maintaining inventory levels.",external
"Also, receiving positive feedback from colleagues and stakeholders shows the accuracy of my work.",external
"When I complete my job, if I get positive feedback, I feel I have performed well.",external
"First, I look at different scenarios and their potential impacts on the supply chain.",mixed
I use data and past performances to inform decisions.,external
I also discuss with team members and supervisors to align decisions with company goals.,external
"The ideal work environment would have clear and open communication, teamwork, opportunities for continuous learning, and access to the latest technology to streamline the supply chain.",mixed
"Everyone has good and bad days, but we try our best.",mixed
"To tell the truth, I haven’t thought much about it.",mixed
"Usually, my day off involves going to the gym or seeing my girlfriend.",mixed
My day starts by checking emails and updates from suppliers.,mixed
"I ensure there are no immediate issues requiring attention, coordinate with my team to plan tasks, confirm delivery schedules, resolve logistical issues, and participate in meetings with other departments.",mixed
Two years.,mixed
"Recently, I streamlined the supply chain process, reducing delivery times by 5% by implementing a new tracking system and improving communication with suppliers.",mixed
I try to do my best every day.,internal
"Every task, big or small, is an opportunity for growth.",mixed
"Previously, decisions were based on feelings without clear leadership.",internal
"Now, our system is more hierarchical, with a directive style.",mixed
Feedback is encouraged to improve workflows.,mixed
"Yes, I find this system effective.",internal
I’m comfortable as long as the company achieves its goals.,external
"My company operates globally, specializing in oil and natural gas extraction and refinement.",mixed
"We manage complex supply chains to ensure smooth operations, from sourcing raw materials to delivering products worldwide.",mixed
"Our focus is on logistics, innovation, and sustainability.",mixed
"Yes, we work closely with these countries and aim to strengthen future collaborations.",mixed
Okay.,mixed
It is my greatest pleasure to participate in the HSE university project.,mixed
"So, let me do a brief introduction about myself.",mixed
My name is Anon.,mixed
I came from China.,mixed
My Chinese name is Anon.,mixed
"Nowadays, I'm studying my Master's Degree in High School of Economics in Russia, St. Petersburg campus.",mixed
"It is my greatest pleasure to illustrate anything related to the cultural code of China, because China is the country that I had been living for my entire life.",mixed
Around 20 years.,mixed
So I have my own perspectives around anything related to culture in China.,internal
"So maybe it will be somehow very different with most of the people's views, but I hope you can understand me very well, okay.",internal
"Yeah, currently.",mixed
Right now I am working full-time in a restaurant.,mixed
"That restaurant was opened by Russian people, but it is a Chinese restaurant.",mixed
"The name of the restaurant is the Pisha Dynasty Ming, and that place previously was the museum of Joseph Brodsky and Alexander Brodsky, because Joseph Brodsky's favorite dish was the Chinese food.",mixed
"You know, he was the greatest writer in the former Soviet Union.",mixed
"When he received the Nobel Prize of Literature, he was having Chinese food in a Chinese restaurant in the town street of London, something like this.",mixed
"Yes, because in HSE we have very demanding standards, you know, our professor asked all the foreign students to find interviews or a full-time job by themselves.",mixed
"For me, I was working as a Chinese social media marketing manager and doing all shifts in that restaurant.",mixed
Previously I never found a job by myself so this time I do realize that it is very difficult to make money on your own.,external
"So, I get to know that it is very important for me to save the money, because earn money isn't that easy.",external
"You know, money isn't a blood, but a vein or something like this.",mixed
"Yes, yes, yes, yes.",mixed
I do like the company's atmosphere.,internal
"You know, there's quite a different the culture code between the companies in Russia and that in China.",mixed
Russian companies are very tolerant to the newcomers.,mixed
Sometimes I make some very big mistakes.,mixed
I was scolded by my boss a lot and my employees a lot.,mixed
"Sometimes, you know, I don't know the culture's code in the Russian company.",mixed
"But it is worth to try to make mistakes because after you make mistakes, you start to realize that you shouldn't do such things.",mixed
"For example, you shouldn't eat in an open space because it was quite impolite.",mixed
"And also, when the customers go inside of the restaurant, it is necessary for them to take off their coats.",mixed
"But in China, the Chinese restaurants won't work in this way.",mixed
"Because in China, you know, we even don't have the wardrobe to put the clothes to.",mixed
"Because in China, we don't have these customs.",mixed
"And we don't have some occupations to hire someone to put the customers closest to the rightest place, we don't have these occupations.",mixed
That's the main difference between the Russian restaurant and the Chinese restaurant.,mixed
"And also, in the Russian restaurant, it is okay that if sometimes the customers give you some tips but in China no one is allowed to give tips to the workers.",mixed
"Because you know the Chinese people, in their opinion you work for this job, so you do the job that you were required to.",mixed
"And also, the boss sometimes forbids their employees to get some extra money from the customers because they think the customers should give all the money to the boss rather than to the employees.",mixed
"The only way for the employees to receive money is from their boss, not from the customers.",mixed
"But in China, you know, the Chinese people they are actually kind of working overtime for free and all the Chinese people they get used to it.",mixed
So that's the main difference between the working environment from the western culture and the oriental culture.,mixed
"It was quite stressful and quite overloaded in the oriental countries, you know, it is very hard to get money.",mixed
"But in the Western countries, you know, working as a waiter in restaurants was pretty fun.",internal
You can get appreciation from your customers.,external
"And also, the tips, something like this.",mixed
"Yes, I think the biggest motivation is that my boss, Anna, she provided me all the documents that was necessary to let me pass from the internships.",mixed
She provided all the documents of the company and also she let the general manager sign the contracts to me.,mixed
"She was pretty; she treated me pretty nice and also you know in my working place everyone is hard-working, but they are not, they are not competitive viciously.",mixed
You know in Chinese cultures in Chinese companies everyone kind of treats everyone around them as competitors.,mixed
"But now in my working place everyone treats each other as a friend, as their important person.",mixed
"They are kind, they help each other, even if sometimes someone gets higher salaries than them, they won't be journeyers.",mixed
"But in China, no.",mixed
"If one of the employees has higher salaries than them, oh, they start to say some bad words to them, they kind of stab them in the back.",mixed
"That is very bad, you know, atmosphere in the Chinese company.",internal
"So, you know, a lot of people, they kind of don't want to work because they receive a lot of pressure for the relationships because some of the employees, they are jealous of them, they don't want them to have a good life, they don't want them to have good salaries, they kind of complain about them secretly and also say some bad words to them.",mixed
Let's note the colleagues.,mixed
I really want to work in some place with really good colleagues rather than the competitors.,internal
I don't want to get a high salary; I just want to do my job and give the best services to the customer.,internal
I don't want to spend any time doing something that I think is useless for managing the relationship.,internal
"If this person really doesn’t like me, just doesn't talk with me.",mixed
Sometimes you know in China you have had to manage it.,mixed
You have had to spend more time on to managing the relationship.,mixed
"You know, if the relationship went bad in your working place, it would bring a lot of pressure and unhappiness to you, something like this.",mixed
"Yes, because while I was a waiter in my working place, I really do like to have some small talk with the customers.",internal
"Even though I speak Russian so-so, they still don't think that I'm a very low employee.",mixed
They give me a lot of encouragement.,mixed
"Actually, I was very surprised that all the Russian people are kind of speaking English very well.",internal
"So, it is true that the education level of Russian people is very high, it's higher than that in China.",mixed
"You know while the customers were finishing their meal and they came to my place to pick up their clothes, I would like to say: hello, sir, «Было вкусно» , they would say: «Спасибо», and then I will say: «You are welcome to come here again».",mixed
"Some of my Russian customers really want to talk more with me about my experience, about their experience.",mixed
"I would really like to, you know, talk with them.",internal
"And my boss was very surprised that I can manage the relationship between the customers and the company so good, because it is very necessary for us to build a long-term good relationship with the customers.",mixed
"We call this CRM management, customers relationship management.",mixed
"So, every time I was talking very with customers, Russian customers, my boss was very happy.",external
And every time I saw some Russian customers left some very good reviews to me on the ESS web of our restaurant I was so happy.,external
Something like this.,mixed
"Because it is a Russian restaurant, people never thought that they would hire Chinese people to make the culture here much more diverse, and people feel that I was very rare in the Russian restaurant and they can't stop to talk with me because they really want to speak with the foreigners.",mixed
"I can see that the Russian people they treat everyone very good, very hospitable.",mixed
"Every time a lot of Russian people came to me, and they may have thought that I can't speak Russian very well and they talked with me using English very actively because they really want to know me and make friends with me.",mixed
Sometimes I get tips from them.,mixed
I feel really happy.,internal
"And also, some Russian customers, they can't speak English very well, but I can understand what they want me to do for them.",mixed
"Oh, I don't know what they were talking about, but I know that I just give the clothes to them and let them pick up something from their pockets, because I can get to know what's their intentions from the same languages.",mixed
And sometimes they just want to smoke.,mixed
"I will tell them, there were some blankets by the doors.",mixed
"If you really want to go outside for cigarettes, you can pick up some blankets rather than your coat.",mixed
Something like this.,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
"Language isn't the key, but sometimes you need to use it hard to get to know what they want.",mixed
Something like this.,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
"Yeah, I'm glad to help you.",internal
If you have chance you can come to visit my restaurant also.,mixed
"Yeah, no worries, and it was kind of one of the best Chinese restaurants in St. Petersburg and also one of the landmarks in St. Petersburg, something like this.",mixed
"Yeah, we are kind of three in one.",mixed
"We have the restaurant, we have the bar and also, we have the smoke zone, something like this.",mixed
The most valuable lesson that I think I have learned from my working place was that you should never underestimate the occupation that you are going with.,mixed
"You know sometimes some people feel like: I don't want to be a waiter because waiter is a very low skilled job, I can't learn anything from such low job occupations because it makes me a low person, but the reality doesn't work this way.",mixed
"Some Chinese people have very high vanity, they like to buy luxury goods to show their data scores, and they want to be a manager in some famous companies like JP Morgan, like Citi, but sometimes you shouldn't make your expectations so high.",mixed
"If you have such high expectations for your future, for your occupations, for your future careers, you have a high possibility of being disappointed if you didn't reach your goals.",mixed
So I put my goals very low because I know my ability.,internal
Previously I also behaved as most of the Chinese people.,external
I want to go to one of the top 20 universities in the world and after graduation I will be a super manager in some top 100 companies in the world.,internal
"But sometimes, that isn't the future of you.",mixed
Sometimes you desire very low at first.,mixed
"Do some, you can just divide your goals into some achievable goals and achieve the goals step by step.",mixed
Just make yourself as low as possible.,mixed
Sometimes don't give too many expectations to yourself.,mixed
"You know, previously I also was seeking some manager jobs in some big company in St. Petersburg, but I failed.",mixed
"So, I started to make myself as low as possible to do something that I can do, but it doesn't mean that I'm a low person.",internal
I did a great job.,internal
I love my job.,internal
"It isn't that high, but I receive good salaries.",mixed
"I receive 70,000 rubles for one month.",mixed
"I receive tips every day, and I receive some love letters from girls.",mixed
"I have my own surprise, you know.",mixed
"You know, every day I come to my restaurant, I have surprises.",mixed
I met different people.,mixed
"I knew new people and I get free coffee, I get a free meal, I get a free taxi back home, you know sometimes you shouldn’t image yourself so perfectly just treat yourself as low as possible do some lawless job from the very beginning.",mixed
This is the greatest lesson that I learned from my workplace.,internal
"It depends on the country, I think.",mixed
"To have some restaurants in Russia, it is a money-making industry, but if you want to have a restaurant in China it's goanna be a problem, because nowadays China doesn't have a very good environment.",mixed
"A lot of the youngsters, millennials, generation Z, they are kind of having no opportunities in China because all the opportunities have been occupied by the older generations.",mixed
"You know, in this year, China will have 10 million graduates, but only 10% of them, they will be able to find decent job.",mixed
"But 90% of the Chinese graduates, they will be confronted with unemployment.",mixed
That's a serious problem.,mixed
"But also, you know, China nowadays has a lot of down industries.",mixed
"For example, the brick and mortar and the physical stores.",mixed
"If I want to have a restaurant in China, I need to pay for the rent.",mixed
"I need to pay for the electricity, water, employees, food, everything.",mixed
"You know, a lot of the Chinese customers, they are very picky, they are very fastidious.",mixed
"You know, doing something related to this restaurant in China, you will spend all of your time doing something useless, I think.",mixed
"It won't make you money, but it definitely will make you lose a lot of money.",mixed
"So, I won't consider having a restaurant in China, but maybe I will have some restaurants related with African food in Russia.",internal
"Because, you know, in Russia, you have never heard about the African food, right?",mixed
But the African food is very popular.,mixed
"One of my best friends, William, cooked me a lot of Nigerian stew meat.",mixed
I really like this dish.,mixed
"So, as far as I can see, in Russia, there isn’t any African restaurants.",mixed
"I will be very glad to have some African restaurants in Russia, maybe in Yekaterinburg, maybe in Vladivostok, yeah, for these two cities, something like this.",mixed
"Yes, yes, yes.",mixed
"It really depends on the situation, because I really want to continue to study my PhD degree of management in Russia because the Russian government, they were very willing to provide me the full scholarship.",mixed
It gives me a huge motivation because it means that I'm good student.,external
I'ma  hard-working student and PhD because I like studying.,internal
"Studying turns me into a better human being, but I think I had already chosen my destination in Russia.",internal
I would be very willing to go to Yekaterinburg or Vladivostok.,internal
"So Vladivostok is very near to China, and also it has very beautiful Japanese seas.",mixed
"That's a good place for me to go, but also Yekaterinburg, because I really can't make the decision right now, because I had already let my best friend, Troby, who can speak five languages, I had already let my best friend help me apply for the full scholarship of my PhD degrees.",mixed
"If I get the full scholarship of my PhD degree in Yekaterinburg, I will go to Yekaterinburg.",mixed
"If I get that in Vladivostok, I will go to Vladivostok, something like this.",mixed
So and also while I was studying my PhD degrees I will start here to do my Tik-Tok because I'm also a blogger and also influencer in China.,mixed
"I will continue to do my tik-tok and make my outcomes, have millions of fans, so I can do some endorsements to some brands you know, I can be a superstar.",mixed
"I think learning Russian is the most important part because the first time that I've been to Russia was in 2019, and since then I was studying Russian as a minor language, composed really, but I didn't pay a lot of attention to Russian because I can speak English to everyone around me, so I spent most of my time on improving my English.",mixed
"Nowadays, even right now, I am reading some English literature every day to remember some native expressions or something like this.",mixed
"But Russian is a very important language for me to grasp because if I want to live in Russia and continue to build some bond with Russian entrepreneurs, I must learn Russian because not all the Russian people can speak English.",mixed
"And also, you know, in China they have a very good relationship with people, with countries in the Middle Asia.",mixed
"For example, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and also Russia, Belarus, Ukraine.",mixed
The Russian is the dominant language in this zone.,mixed
"And for example, one of my main friends in my restaurant, he's from Uzbekistan.",mixed
"He likes me very much, but he can't speak English.",mixed
"Every time he was saying something like ""Hi, how are you?"". ",mixed
And he was worried about whether I'm hungry or not.,mixed
He treated me very well.,mixed
"I really want to talk to him, but I can't speak Russian.",mixed
So that's a pity.,mixed
"So in the future, Russian is the main thing that I need to improve.",mixed
"Because if I want to have business in Russia and in the Middle East, Middle Asia countries, I must learn Russian.",mixed
Something like this.,mixed
Critics?,mixed
I think I have been scolded and criticized a lot.,mixed
"I think if someone, especially your boss, criticized you, you should accept it.",external
"Everyone will be negative, they will somehow have some negative emotions with regard to the critics, but the critics can improve your behavior.",mixed
"You must know that something isn't appropriate for you to do, because the first time if you make mistakes, you got scolded, that's totally fine because you don't know anything, but I'm the person that won't make the same mistake again.",mixed
"I can make a lot of mistakes, but different mistakes, I won't make the same mistake again.",mixed
That's very important.,mixed
"And sometimes you should be very critical-thinking, you know.",mixed
Getting scolded isn't your problem.,mixed
And you should appreciate the critics from the others because they are helping you.,external
They are saving you.,mixed
"You know, in China we have an old saying that if you want to destroy a person, just say glorious words to him or her for every day.",mixed
He will be drowned in himself or herself and he will continue to die because of his mistake.,mixed
He doesn’t know his mistake.,mixed
"It is a good way for you to know your own mistakes because actually I think the mistakes make you grow up, make you a better person, something like this, so you should be appreciative of all the mistakes that you have made.",mixed
"You know, sometimes I feel that I have made a lot of mistakes in the past, and sometimes I can’t reconcile with myself perfectly because I feel that I was totally a failure.",internal
"No, because at least, I was very thankful for all the mistakes, for all the experiences that I had in my life, because without this, I couldn't be myself right now, something like this.",mixed
"Yes, yes, yes, yes.",mixed
I think I prefer to work in a team.,mixed
Sometimes I don't want to be overloaded because previously I was in a team and my teammates did nothing and I do all the home assignments by myself and they get the scores with no efforts dedicated.,mixed
"But right now, you see, I really like to work in the team with some hard-working teammates.",internal
"They are dividing the task equally and they can help you and sometimes, you know, working in a team can help you to know each other better, can help you work collaboratively with others.",mixed
"You know, working in a team is very important because in China we say that you can't do everything alone by yourself.",external
But you have to get used to working in team because right now I only value exchange and effective communications.,internal
Value exchange is the preliminary stage of value of working in a team.,mixed
"You need to use other people's advantages to achieve your goals, and you need to give them some benefits.",mixed
Something like this.,mixed
The value exchange is a very important tool for you to be successful because it is too weak for you to do everything alone by yourself.,mixed
It's better to collaborate with others who have the valuable values that you can use.,external
Something like this.,mixed
"From my personal perspective if we want to win together I can let you win more you know sometimes 50/50 isn't a good deal I can get 30 you get 70 percent something like this but conflict means that we have some unsatisfications between each other, so we need to solve this.",external
"Because if conflicts existed, that means both of us, have problems.",mixed
"So, we need to point out the problems first.",mixed
"For example, if it is my problem, I was too emotional, oh, I need to change, I need to manage my emotions.",internal
But this is also your problem.,external
You were debating with me for all the time.,external
This is your problem.,external
You also need to change.,external
"You know, we need, both of us, we need to change.",mixed
"No, if the if the conflicts existed, which means both of us, they need to make some change and improve the models that we were getting along with each other, something like this.",mixed
Work-life balance.,mixed
"Sometimes the balance doesn't exist at all, because right now I am working full-time.",mixed
"Every time when I get back home, I don't even have the time to wash my clothes, to eat.",mixed
I just want to sleep.,mixed
"Sometimes, for me, I need to sacrifice life first and dedicate everything to the work, because it isn't that easy to get money.",mixed
"If you want to get the work-life balance, you need to be financially independent first.",mixed
"But if you are not financially independent first, then you need to sacrifice one.",mixed
Everyone is sacrificing life right now to get more money from the work.,mixed
"Not only me, but everybody does the same.",external
"I can't say that I'm good in time management, but at least I'm a responsible guy.",internal
As long as it's a task dedicated from my boss or for my teachers I will do it.,external
Before the deadlines.,mixed
"You know, I'm not a person that makes plans.",internal
I do everything very casually.,mixed
"So, I kind of catch up the deadlines, you know, at the last day or something like this.",mixed
I'm a guy like this.,mixed
But it depends on the person.,mixed
"I really want to say that because I don't like to make plans, because I know that every day, there will be a lot of unexpected things to happen.",internal
"Making plans, I don't think it's very important for me.",internal
"If I made plans, I would have to change my plans for everything.",internal
I hope I really do help you with your projects.,internal
You too.,mixed
"Mr. Michael, welcome.",mixed
It's my pleasure.,internal
"Okay, thank you for your question.",mixed
I'm an operations manager for a right heading business.,mixed
And the drivers come in to pick them up.,mixed
I have 15 people working under me.,mixed
"So basically with the operation team, we make sure that the app is functioning well.",mixed
Drivers are being paid with their balances on the app.,mixed
We are giving them the right campaigns that will motivate them to do their business.,mixed
And we are also solving issues when it comes to bad driver behavior.,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
And bad rider behavior too.,mixed
So basically I think that's the entirety of my job responsibilities.,mixed
"And it's my duty to make sure that, uh, people working under me.",mixed
"Uh, most of the times the job is more about dedication, just making sure you are appointing or you're selecting the right subordinate for the right job and empowering them to also become their own bosses in the future.",external
Thank you.,mixed
I really love my working environment.,internal
It's an information service company.,mixed
"So I think for me, one particular thing that I admire so much is the fact that I can just pick my t-shirt, pick my trailer, and wear my sneaker and go to work.",internal
"So the company has a term called we don't, we don't entertain corporate bullshit.",mixed
"Like I don't have to be in a suit and tie before I can perform, perform, uh, exceptionally well at my workplace.",mixed
"Uh, we, we are just a team of young people, so you always come to see enthusiasm.",mixed
"There, there is always that exchange of ideas.",mixed
"People share their ideas and there are lots of bright minds, minds around.",mixed
"So always you are, you are that excited to come to work, to listen to what someone would want to say, or some idea that will come up from even the, the lowest of person in the rank that you don't, you don't expect at the workplace.",external
So basically that is how my job environment environments is.,mixed
You are welcome.,mixed
"Thank, thank you for the question.",mixed
"So in as much as as a business, we always would want to meet our KPIs, meet our business goals, get more revenues, uh, generate more net profits, like get more net profits.",external
Thank you.,mixed
Thank you very much for the question.,mixed
"So for me, the most recent achievement is the expansion, the business expansion that we did recently in 2024.",internal
"So we realized as a business we were just, uh, dominant in a crime.",external
"And we had to spread, spread our wings, commercial integrity, and we had to spread our wings to other citizens.",mixed
"And you see the most, most of the times in cities, countries like Ghana or in Africa, people there are always in the capital.",mixed
So people coming from other cities will always be in the capital.,mixed
"And when they are coming from your cities and they have an idea or they have some knowledge about your business already, when they come, it becomes easy for them to use your services.",mixed
"I know definitely that based on our calculations and our projections, we realize that we are not really going to operate in certain areas.",external
They're not going to really yield more profits like that.,mixed
But it had more benefits for our performance in Accra.,mixed
And definitely it's like it happened and it boomed.,mixed
"We, we launched our operations in the northern parts of Ghana.",mixed
"We did for Origin, we did for Cape Coast.",mixed
Because the internet penetration in Ghana is not that huge.,mixed
And basically we would want people to know about us.,mixed
We have to go to places where people will be comfortable with us.,external
"Then when they come in that capacity, it'll become very easy for them to use our services.",mixed
"So for me, I think that is a very good achievement as a business to not to only look at the profitability side, but to look at the overall impact it will have on the entire business as a whole.",internal
You're welcome.,mixed
"Okay, thank you for your question.",mixed
"So for me, decision making as a manager is one of the most challenging activities or challenging responsibilities on your decks because if you don't create room for people to come up with ideas or if you don't create room for dialogue to be made or collaboration be made, it always makes you fixated to something that is a cake, something that is rigid, something that makes it very, very difficult for your people or team members to adjust or play their part in implementing the decision after it's been made because, uh, there is a saying that, idea is not in one month's head rise.",external
"And the youth, there's also another saying that the, the young ones are the one full of ideas.",external
"So if you open that room for people to make, definitely in the business sector, the final decision has to come, come from the manager, right?",external
Or the final decision has to come from the board.,external
"But if you give room for people to also come up with ideas and that decision is being made and you credit the people that came up with ideas, it helps to foster that coordination, that collaboration in the business.",external
And it helps people to appreciate what their input that they are bringing to the table.,external
And they tend to to stay longer and give more and better results for the company.,mixed
"So for me, out all my decisions that I make in the company, I always make sure that I have my team involved.",external
"It's not a one month thing, it's a collaborating thing.",external
Then we do it and we do it together to achieve the resource that we want.,external
We have quite a number of partnerships because sometimes we provide PS on our platform to motivate hardworking drivers.,mixed
And also sometimes we provide ps for let me say truthful passengers.,mixed
"For example there's a passenger that, no, for truthful drivers, there's a driver that someone left huge sums of money in his car and he returned it.",mixed
"But if it had been somebody who tried to be corny and run away with the money, it would take some time for us to get him.",mixed
And we also provide insurance.,mixed
We work with insurance companies to provide some insurance packages for the drivers.,mixed
We also work with a network company.,mixed
"I think before July, 2024, we signed the biggest network company in Ghana, um, to provide some data services for our drivers, which they started implementing in September, which is actually a good thing.",mixed
"So you can, no one is an airline.",mixed
"You can't do everything on your own, no matter what.",external
We also have partnership with some four stations.,mixed
We provide four vouchers.,mixed
"Uh, we have a partnership with one, uh, maintenance comment, car maintenance shop in AC garage, which helps our top performing drivers to service their cars and maintain their tires and those things.",mixed
We definitely would need services from people and it is always good for businesses to bond and do business together.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
Thank you for your question.,mixed
"So when it comes to information dissemination, I think with my company, I think in the beginning of our conversation, I made mention of the fact that we don't entertain corporate bullshit.",internal
Not to say that we don't have a procedure or a proper way of communication in our company.,mixed
We do have a proper way of com communication in our company.,mixed
"We use an internal communication platform called ""We"".",mixed
"We do have access to corporate emails and other stuff, but it's an internal communication to call Slack.",mixed
"Where each one has particular channels, particular groups, there are channels for general manager.",mixed
"There are channels for managers, there are channels for the executive board.",mixed
"There are channels for project managers, operation managers, uh, customer support managers, like all these channels are there where we communicate, we tag people that are responsible for particular jobs and other stuff.",mixed
But I have people that supervise me.,mixed
"If I want to communicate anything to my bosses, there's nothing that can't stop me from channeling my ideas or asking them question about anything that there is that openness in our, in my company.",mixed
"Because you are not allowed to restrict someone from making their point because no one knows the reason, the reason why as a company, we stand with this with distance is because one of our verticals that we are operating, I think the business operates in 150 countries, started by someone who was lower in the rank.",mixed
"It was his idea that brought up that vertical and it was being worked on and became bigger and bigger, started generating more revenue than even the oldest vertical.",mixed
Like it started generating almost half of the revenue in the oldest vertical the business was generating.,mixed
So our communication is open.,mixed
"You talk to your, you talk to, there is that proper feedback system we have.",mixed
"We do reviews of performances, we do reviews of attacks, all those things.",mixed
"And people, whenever there are issues or there are conflicts, we find the best way to resolve this conflict.",mixed
"And as so far as we are, we are humans.",mixed
There will be one or two issues of people having one or two misunderstandings with a colleague or with a workmate.,mixed
"And we find out the best way to resolve this and not to make these people have hidden hate within, within the team to affect the overall team performance.",mixed
I get what you're saying.,mixed
"Yeah, yeah, sure.",mixed
"I think I've worked a number of jobs as a person, I started after uni, I started as a teacher.",mixed
"I did some freelance job, uh, personally as an IT support, like I was moving around supporting people, people who needed my services.",mixed
Then I worked with the mining servicing company for six months before I moved into the tech industry proper.,mixed
"So I would say from the mining services company, after that I've been with my company for six years.",mixed
"So the mining services company, the only difference I see is with the mining services company, they are using a traditional approach.",mixed
"If your boss says this, you cannot say the otherwise.",external
You understand.,mixed
"If your boss says, you cannot even chip in your idea what you think, because the whole perception is you are just fresh from school, you don't really have any sort of experience.",external
"You're not supposed to be the one to question my idea or you're not supposed to be the one, don't object.",mixed
"What I come up with, just follow the rules and do your work.",internal
Right.,mixed
"In the bias servicing company, you are supposed to dress in a particular way, always you look like, uh, I don't know how to put it, but with my current job, I can just put my t-shirts, I can even put on, um, cam shoes and come to work.",mixed
"I when I come to work, I can take my sneaker off and put on my Crocs and just do my work.",mixed
"Mine is just to do my work, not necessarily how I look or how, and one of the thing I love about my current job is the fact that I work three days in the office, two days in the house.",internal
So that's for me that those things are the major differences why I've come to love working here.,internal
And I would probably would love to keep spending some time here and help them do very well as a business and expand across more cities in Ghana.,internal
So I have a funny story about my probation.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
And I think I would say this as an advice for anyone that will ever go into any business and will be put on probation.,internal
"For me, I think the key thing that managers want to see during probation is someone that is willing to learn.",internal
"Because no matter where I came from, you might have the experience already, but sectors and fuels and companies are different in terms of procedures and protocols and operations.",mixed
Okay?,mixed
Right.,mixed
"So regardless of the principle, the experience you came with, just have that adaptability spirit to adapt to the system that you were in.",external
"When I joined my company, I joined with one guy.",mixed
"He was, you know, in Ghana, uh, people consider that people from asasi to be brighter than any because of the structure of learning and the kind of lecturers they have in their school.",mixed
So I joined with one guy from Asasi.,mixed
"He was, I think he was, let me say he was ranked higher than me because of the university he was coming from.",mixed
"But that guy didn't have the desire and the energy, the hunger and the test that I had or the passion I had for the work.",internal
"Because although I came from the IT field, I was new to data analytics, if you understand.",mixed
"And how quick I was able to adapt, adapt and adapt to the business goals and the business metrics and those things.",external
"And how I was able to understand the connectivity of these metrics and the things that I'm supposed to do to, if A is misbehaving, things I'm supposed to do with B to make sure it's part A, if C'S misbehaving what I'm supposed to do to part A.",mixed
"And those things, at that time the business was going through some kind of rough patch, but I believe it was those things that made them realize that no, regardless of the the struggles that we are going through, this guy is more hungry for success and we have to give him the chance to stay and also help him to become better.",external
"So for me, probation, the most important thing is let the organization see that willingness to learn and that spirit of adaptability and let them see that, that design, passion, passion you spoke about during your interview.",external
"Yeah, sure.",mixed
"Mentorship, but even as I'm sitting here, I like, I still need ten more mentors.",mixed
"Mentorship, mentorship is very, very important because in as much as we as people, we always say that make your own mistakes and learn from them.",external
It's always best to know someone's mistake and learn from learn from that mistake.,external
"It makes it shorter and simpler because we don't have time, we think we have time in this life, we don't have that much time.",mixed
"By the time you will be done making your mistakes and learning from them, time would've been far spent, far gone.",mixed
And you will not be able to achieve what you would want to achieve.,mixed
"So mentorship is important for me, I'll keep on looking for more mentors, people that can help me, guide me, and who will motivate me to become a better version of myself.",external
And I would love to mentor people.,external
"My doors are always open for other people, black people to come, so that I can also share what I've learned and the knowledge I've gained.",external
"So far, but, I still have some people I mentor when it comes to work and when it comes to, let me say, public Christian life.",mixed
So that is it when it comes to mentorship.,mixed
"Okay, thank you for your question.",mixed
"So when it comes to motivation, I would say that family is my motivation in everything that I do because when I wake up in the morning, I look at my wife's face, uh, it motivates me.",external
"I look at my kids' face, it motivates me because basically I need to feed them.",external
I need to take care of the home.,external
"I need to take care of my extended family: my dad, my mom, my sisters.",external
"Uh, I didn't come alone in this life.",external
"So always there are people, people I look up to, to draw energy from, to draw enthusiasm from.",external
"But for me, I think I always would want to, I always say that sometimes with motivation it diminishes.",mixed
"So I always try my best to keep that spirit of discipline because discipline is more of like, uh, it's like if you're able to develop that discipline, it's like cocaine.",mixed
You can't stop.,mixed
"Like it's always, it is always flaming in you, when you want to get, you have to do.",internal
"And when it comes to challenges at work, when I joined my visit, my company had understand, I think I had, at that point in time, I had not learned how to, how to withstand challenges.",internal
"And whenever we are in turbulence, I start to panic and I start to, I start to pass on the negative energy onto subordinate advice.",external
"So at the point I started learning from that, and at the moment I think I can, I can probably say that, uh, I've learned how to become calm.",internal
I've learned how to understand that everything that happens will pass.,internal
Like it's just for a particular moment.,mixed
"Like those things are faces, like it will pass.",mixed
"'cause during covid time we went down, like, much like our projection went down.",mixed
"Like there was lockdown, businesses were closing down, like things worked out and nothing was happening.",mixed
"And we were, I was scared.",internal
"Like I wasn't really, really scared for myself because I felt that if even if the company sinks, with the lot of experience that I have, I might get a different job if things become normal.",internal
"But I was scared for the new guys that had entered like the fresh people, that had put their trust in me for me to help them grow and for me to help them push them to the higher heights.",external
"And all of a sudden, my idea came in mind and we created a protected category in Ghana for the first time, and people like bounced to the idea and our members started jumping and growing and growing and growing.",mixed
So those moments taught me very important message in life that sometimes you just have to be calm.,internal
If you're a Christian you just have to pray because God actually is the give off ideas and knowledge.,mixed
"So for me, challenges shouldn't be something to make you fold and make you make you slow down.",internal
"It's a pleasure to talking to you, Mr.",mixed
I'm good.,internal
You?,mixed
"So actually, thank you for having me.",mixed
"Yeah, sure.",mixed
"So, you know, my name is M.B. Shtiak and I am from Australia, Sydney, Australia.",mixed
And I lived in Bangladesh last five years.,mixed
I used to work in human resources.	,mixed
I worked with multinational companies and international development organizations before.,mixed
"And in Australia, I'm actually pursuing my masters right now.",mixed
I doing a master of business management at Central Queensland University.,mixed
"And also, I'm working in a retail shop as a retail associate.",mixed
Okay okay.,mixed
Uh before that.,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
So in Australia my work is a retail associate which i've just told you and before that.,mixed
"Yes, I have worked near about five years in human resources and my last job was with a multinational company and that was genpa Bangladesh, it's a subsidiary of Julpa UAE that's one of UAE's largest producer and exporter of medicines and before that I worked with Friendship International, an international development organization.",mixed
"I worked there for about three years so altogether my work experience in human resources is five years, a little bit more than five years.",mixed
And yeah.,mixed
"Yeah, so I've actually worked in two different work setups because before I moved to Australia, I've never worked in retail.",mixed
Retail is totally different than what I used to do in Bangladesh because that was like nine to five corporate job.,mixed
That was like a desk job but in Australia it's like a retail job.,mixed
So uh that was quite new for me because i've never worked in retail before and if you ask me about work culture difference i wouldn't be able to describe an official setup in Australia because I didn't work in an office setup in Australia yet so I'm yet to experience that.,internal
"But in retail, it's very fast paced.",mixed
"And the thing is you have to work in a team, of course.",mixed
And that's quite similar to how we used to work in Bangladesh as well.,mixed
"I mean, you have to work in teams and also work culture is like in Bangladesh, people are more emotional and here people are more practical.",mixed
"So also there's another significant difference that I have noticed so far is in Bangladesh, some local organizations, fortunately, I didn't have to work with a lot of local organizations, I worked with like multinationals and INGOs.",internal
But I have had friends who have worked with like local organizations.,mixed
"And there it was, it was something like when you ask for a leave and your employer, they don't seem to be very happy about it, even though you are entitled to take leaves, like sick leaves, casual leaves, whatever.",mixed
So this is a significant change here in Australia.,mixed
"So, yeah, these are a few significant changes that I have noticed so far.",internal
Okay.,mixed
So i'll give you a very practical answer to that because a lot of fabricated answers would sound like so I love to help people and all for me.,internal
"Actually because I have been working human resources before I love to work with people, I love helping people and even though I have never worked in retail, this kind of job, working in retail, it requires you to be a very good communicator.",internal
And also you have to be able to help people.,external
"Because in retail, what happens, when someone comes to your store, they're actually looking for something.",mixed
So you are there to help them make that purchase decision or make suggestions based on their needs.,internal
That's what I enjoy about my job.,internal
"That would be a very generalized answer but in addition to that since i was new to a retail sector and for the first week I didn't even think that I could survive the retail environment, because I moved to Australia from a different country, and some people from eastern suburbs have a distinct accent which I was having like a really hard time trying to understand.",internal
"But eventually after a week, I actually started to get their accent, started to understand what they're trying to say.",mixed
And I started to communicate well.,mixed
"What excites me most about my job is if the store makes the budget, I mean like daily budget and then we have a weekly budget and then a monthly budget, if the store makes budget you get bonus so for me it's like entirely money.",external
"Money motivates me because I'm an international student here and I have a lot of bills to pay, I have to save for my university as well, so expenses as well tuition fees etc etc.",external
"I have to pay like every kind of bills that I have, so for me if I do well in my job that means I'll get some bonus at the end of the month.",external
"So doing well in my job is not an option for me, that's what I strive to do because I know a lot of people will give you a different answer, but for me money is the biggest motivator.",external
"So it motivates me, that's what actually excites me about my job.",external
Valuable lessons?,mixed
Yeah.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
So that should be never to take anything to heart because I have had very difficult customer who would make some racist comments.,internal
"Also, I've had really good customers at the same time most of my customers are really good.",mixed
"The one valuable lesson that I learned from my job is to let go of whatever is bothering you, you have to let it go.",internal
If you let it ruin your day what will happen that you will lack in performance.,external
"And if you lack in performance, you will not be able to make the budget.",mixed
"So you will still get your salary, of course, but you will not get the bonus that you need to pay a lot of your bills, so for me it's not an option.",internal
For me the valuable lesson is to let go and never take like anything too hard.,internal
Yeah that's what I learned.,mixed
So we are a team of four people in our shop right now.,mixed
"But the thing is even though we are a team, most of the time we work alone because of the store hour.",mixed
We have limited store hours so most of the time we are working by ourselves.,mixed
"But sometimes there are crossovers and for two-three hours we get to work together with another team member, that's at max two people at the same time.",mixed
You compliment each other and you cooperate with each other and especially during rush hour like Christmas season.,mixed
"So if your team performs well and if you are cooperating and communicating well with your team, it gets a lot easier.",mixed
So I'm actually very flexible in terms of working with a team or working by myself.,mixed
Most of the times I work by myself.,mixed
"All right, so I wouldn't say that conflict never happens in my work.",internal
So I have had a fair share of conflicts before and in my current job as well.,mixed
For example I wouldn't say it was a very difficult kind of conflict but sometimes I go extra mile so that my store performs well.,external
"So sometimes when we close at night at around like 9, 10, as it is like high season now, so whenever some other team member closes, they do not always leave the store very tidy.",mixed
They have to do cleanings.,mixed
They have to do all sort of works.,mixed
So it's really difficult.,mixed
"If the last person closing the last night doesn't eave the store tidy, clean and organized, it's very difficult for the next person who comes in to open.",mixed
Okay.,mixed
I had some sort of disagreement with one of my colleagues.,mixed
Work-life balance is simple: you have to have a healthy lifestyle and also you got to work because without work how are you going to pay your bills.,mixed
Right.,mixed
I know my next week's plan because the roaster has been published prior to a week.,mixed
"At least we know what am I going to do forthe next one week and when am I working and when am I not, and when do I have classes, and when do I have exams.",internal
"So I try to manage my time based on that and on weekends I, sometimes like to go to the beach, take a dive into the ocean or hang out with my friends, go to movies, or i love to read a lot of books.",mixed
I carry books with me like everywhere.,mixed
So that's what I do.,mixed
And also sometimes I talk to my parents back at home and my friends.,mixed
"And my friends overseas, I talk to them sometimes.",mixed
I try to stay connected to everyone.,mixed
"That's how I sort of try to  balance my work and life so that I have a social life, I have personal time for myself, and also I have enough time to study and work.",mixed
Okay.,mixed
So I can actually give you an answer in two different ways.,mixed
"From my prior experience experience in human resources, that's what I can do, give you an answer from that perspective and my present perspective.",mixed
"I'll try to blend and give you one simple answer, okay?",mixed
So for someone who's wanting to start their career my suggestion is be bold and also don't be scared of anything.,mixed
When i started working in retail I had zero experience in retail.,mixed
Actually I always have been very good with interviews because I took a lot of interviews in my life.,mixed
So I know what sort of questions are being asked in interview.,mixed
So I was always good at interview and I did well in my interview.,internal
"But when I got the job for retail associate and in my first day at work, I had such cold feet.",internal
"And I was not understanding anyone's accent, like the people of the shire have a different kind of accent, they use a lot of acronyms that I'm not familiar with).",mixed
When I started working in retail I started to doubt.,internal
"Thank you so much, Mr. Ghosh, for having me in your session i hope it helps.",mixed
If you need any further assistance or support regarding whatever queries you might have feel free to write to me.,external
thank you so much for having me.,mixed
Thank you.,mixed
Have a nice rest of the day.,mixed
Bye.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
Great.,mixed
"Hi, everyone.",mixed
"Uh, my name is Farhad.",mixed
"Uh, my last name is Yuldashev.",mixed
"I am deputy Station manager of Uzbekistan Airways in the Russian Federation, based in Moscow.",mixed
"Do I have to describe my position, what I have to do here?",mixed
"Okay, great.",mixed
"Uh, my position is, actually we are responsible for all the regular flights and charter flights, which operate to the Russian Federation.",mixed
And actually we're responsible just for operating flights.,mixed
"The technical, all the technical issues, any questions from passengers.",mixed
We’re responsible for it.,mixed
Actually I like aviation.,internal
"So, to work overseas, it's the best experience for, I think, for everyone.",internal
"So in this case, for me, also, but, the difficulties is, this is foreign country.",internal
"This is not my native country, so that's why it's a little bit difficult to live in another country, not in native country.",internal
And for my family also.,mixed
This is a difficulty.,mixed
"The, the biggest difficulty is this.",mixed
"Uh, sorry?",mixed
"Uh, a little bit, yeah.",mixed
A little.,mixed
"Actually, it's not pointed just in Russia, it's pointed overseas.",mixed
Uzbekistan is native country.,mixed
I'm like a fish in the sea in Uzbekistan.,internal
So that's why it's better to be in Uzbekistan.,mixed
"But for experience, it's a good opportunity to work overseas.",mixed
"Uh, the main motivation is to improve my skills, to improve my working skills, to get more experience.",internal
This motivates me.,external
"Probably, in Tashkent it was an office job.",mixed
"It means I just sit in one cabinet and there is no connection with customers, with people.",mixed
"But in here, when you are responsible for the all the flights, you have the opportunity to speak with passengers, with the staff of the airport, with the crew members of the airplane.",mixed
Also technical issues of the airplanes.,mixed
You will see.,mixed
"This is a good experience for, I think, for every person who works with aviation.",internal
Ideal colleague?,mixed
Interesting question.,mixed
The first one - communication.,mixed
"If we, for example, look the same way, this is good for the person who works with the other person.",mixed
Let me explain.,external
"For example, if I think like my colleague, it's better and easier to work with him or her.",mixed
Also the language level.,mixed
In the Russian Federation as you...,mixed
"Let me explain first: in Uzbekistan, the first language, native language, is the Uzbek language, the second is Russian.",mixed
So it's easy to communicate here.,mixed
And all the staff in our representation speak in Russian.,mixed
It's easy to communicate.,mixed
"And also how to explain... former Soviet Union people, we think similar to how people in the Russian Federation think.",mixed
So this is also easy for...,mixed
"I heard from my colleagues in Europe, in the United States, they think differently from Russia actually, former Soviet Union people.",external
So this is good for work here.,mixed
This is easy.,mixed
Yes-yes...,mixed
I didn't get the idea.,mixed
The biggest problem is the customers.,mixed
"As you know, if you work, it depends on the customer.",external
All the customers are different.,mixed
"Sometimes, in our case, not customers, probably passengers.",mixed
Yeah.,mixed
"Some passengers understand, some passengers don't understand.",mixed
"Some passengers start to explain the rule, which we already know.",mixed
"This is big trouble, how to explain our position.",mixed
Interesting question.,mixed
"Probably we don't have any problems because my colleagues, everything and everybody is well-experienced, and we understand each other, so there is no problem.",mixed
"If we have some trouble with my colleagues, if I have some trouble, I just explain it.",mixed
"If they don't want to understand, I will tell about this to my top manager.",mixed
And he will explain.,mixed
How to organize?,mixed
By letter or by words?,mixed
What do you mean?p,mixed
Communication style?,mixed
"Just knock on the door, open the door, sit and tell everything.",mixed
Yes-yes.,mixed
"Actually, I have two positions in this representation.",mixed
"The first one, I am the deputy representative of the region - regional representation.",mixed
It means that I'm responsible for more than 10 stations in the Russian Federation.,mixed
"This is Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Omsk, Perm et cetera.",mixed
And my second position is I am responsible for the shift at the airport Vnukovo.,mixed
It depends.,mixed
Let me explain how I start my day.,mixed
"The first day I am responsible in Vnukovo airport, daytime.",mixed
"And the second day, the next day, I'm responsible for the nighttime in airport Vnukovo.",mixed
The third day I have a day off because I'm not sleeping all night.,mixed
"So, the fourth day I'm responsible in regional representation and come back again.",mixed
I come to the airport.,mixed
"I check all the information about the flights, which will be in my shift.",mixed
And then start the registration of passengers.,mixed
"During the registration, a lot of questions come from passengers.",mixed
We try to solve this.,mixed
"If they don't understand,  I explained before, I just, we just tell to complain or send the question to our head office.",mixed
That's it.,mixed
And close the registration and depart the flight.,mixed
That's it.,mixed
Yes.,mixed
Same.,mixed
But in the office.,mixed
"In  the regional representation, it's a little bit different because this is office work.",mixed
"We communicate with our stations in the Russian Federation, by email, by the phone, like this.",mixed
It's online actually.,mixed
Yes.,mixed
"In aviation, actually, my professional skills improved, improved a lot.",mixed
"in Uzbekistan, in the head office, my position was in a protocol and visa department specialist.",mixed
"All of other things, it's different.",mixed
So I improved my skills in everything to operate the flight.,external
But before I didn't get that.,mixed
"So when I started to work here, it was news for me.",mixed
And it was a little bit difficult the first time.,mixed
"Thanks to all my colleagues, to everybody.",external
They helped me.,mixed
"They explained what I have to do, what I have to not do.",mixed
"Now  I'm not professional, but I think I'm much improved from before.",internal
In professional career?,mixed
In the Russian Federation?,mixed
To communicate with people.,mixed
"This is a very difficult, very difficult thing, to communicate with people.",mixed
And now it's different because people start to get angry so fast.,mixed
So that's why.,mixed
Before?,mixed
"Yes, because, now I think, in my opinion, people start to think too much about making money.",internal
So that's why they start to be angry.,internal
"Before you said something and it was normal for them, but now they start to get angry so fast.",mixed
My own business?,mixed
"I never think about that because maybe I'm not a businessman, that's why.",internal
"But if I start my own business, what I?...",mixed
In which position?,mixed
You mean?,mixed
"Uh, in which way to start or what?",mixed
"Aviation, maybe.",mixed
Maybe catering.,mixed
It's good also to make money.,mixed
It's interesting to provide the food to flights.,mixed
"Because, you know, the business which comes with food, from this business you can make more money than another, because you spend, for example, $1 and you will get back more.",mixed
"Maybe, that's why.",mixed
…Where… is the catering business?,mixed
The best.,mixed
"You mean, in which city?",mixed
In which country?,mixed
Yeah?,mixed
Where?,mixed
I think it's Turkey.,internal
Because of a lot of flights there.,mixed
"Where there are a lot of flights, you have a lot of customers.",mixed
A lot of customers.,mixed
A lot of money.,mixed
No problem.,mixed
I love it.,internal
"Because I speak English, I remember my English, I start to speak better, but I feel that I forget a lot of words.",internal
It's a little bit different.,mixed
To speak.,mixed
"OK, so my name is Jack, my surname is Jackman.",mixed
"Well, I am from South Korea and I'm 27 years old.",mixed
I studied here in Russia and finished the Saint Peterburg State University of Faculty of Management.,mixed
Now currently I'm working in Russian company named HTS which is producing coolers and chillers and working in international department of exporting the stuff.,mixed
"Well, basically our company has individual plans for each person and we as international staff need to achieve these goals.",mixed
"For example, in the first quarter, I need to make at least 100 cold calls or 20 hot calls.",mixed
"And when I'm finished, this means that I've done my job well.",external
And I just follow the rules of our head managers.,external
"I guess it depends on the situation, depends on question.",mixed
"However, everything in our company related to results.",external
"For example, if you made a decision and this leads to resolution, you will have a bonus.",mixed
"However, if the consequences of this decision are  bad, still the management will tell you that	next time you should think better because it leads to mistakes and even losses for the company.",mixed
"Well, I definitely believe nowadays in my place now where I work, I have the ideal environment of working because in our office, in our department we have 6 managers who are currently working in exporting stuff in the Central Asia region and our work is balanced in terms of how they are all professionals who respect each other.",mixed
"However, we are ready to help each other.",mixed
"For example, if I have questions, I can ask any of my partners and they will help me and if they have questions I also will help them.",mixed
"So this is an ideal environment where everybody is professional, however they always try to help each other.",mixed
Well my work starts at 9:00 AM usually by checking my e-mail because I need to communicate with my partners from other countries and emails is the best way of communication.,mixed
So after checking emails if I have some offers or questions I usually phone call them which is called hot calls until like 13 PM and then I have a break.,mixed
"After the break I just have two hours of co-work with my partners of my department when we discuss our issues, problems or any advantages we made during the day.",mixed
"So after this I just start making cold calls or sending emails with the product, trying to also answer the questions not just employees but also customers.",mixed
"The end of the work day, I just leave some my comments to my partners.",mixed
"I guess last month it wasn't my individual achievement, it was our department achievement where we reached the agreement with with some Uzbek company name trust.",mixed
We created a project where we'll implement our product in their huge project.,mixed
And this project already has been approved by our managers and by their managers and now we're working on details.,mixed
I think this is one of the best deals I have had in our company.,internal
Our I team had.,mixed
"Well, before this place I've worked in Korean company, but it was also located in Russia.",mixed
The company was producing details for cars and I was also managing the company.,mixed
"However, the atmosphere of work wasn't that good because our head department pushed us to hit unrealistic targets.",mixed
But here in my current job at our head office the department head knows what is better and what is achievable.,mixed
That is why I feel more better because now I at least know my goal is achievable.,internal
"And of course, atmosphere is better.",mixed
"As I said earlier, my colleagues are very polite, very friendly and they're ready to help.",mixed
So this is I think the biggest difference.,internal
Describe my company.,mixed
I'm working in HTS company.,mixed
It is a Russian company.,mixed
However it's now it is from 2023.,mixed
I mean it's exploring some international business trying to export its products and I'm currently working in the department of International business.,mixed
"So our company produces chillers, conditioners, coolers and etcetera.",mixed
"It works in many fields like healthcare, railways, some oil companies etcetera.",mixed
"So whenever you need to call in order to produce cool atmosphere, our company is ready to help.",mixed
Thank you for having me.,mixed
Okay my name is Asma and I am an international student in HSE.,mixed
I'm doing my master's here in Arts and Culture Management.,mixed
I'm from Pakistan and apart from my studies I work here in a Russian company which provides services in Fintech so it's been more than one year that I have worked in this company.,mixed
"For me I was new here in St. Petersburg I didn't know anything about the Russian corporate culture and I applied to many jobs and luckily, I got this job in this company which is called ""Call solution"" and to my surprise the environment and the support from the company and also from the government in terms of corporate laws or health issues laws regarding the jobs.",mixed
So the all of these things motivated me to keep going with this job and also with the job the work life balances also really good.,external
So that was the only reason that I did not think to change my job from this job to another job and that's why I have been doing it.,external
Yeah because it is stable and the environment was really really good in comparison to Pakistan.,mixed
"So, the teams, everybody was supportive at work.",mixed
So I really like that and I also like the laws regarding the labor which are Russian laws.,internal
So for me that was the motivation to keep going at this job.,external
With my job yes I was working as a support agent initially for seven or eight months and I was the lucky one and maybe it was my success that in a short period of time I moved from one department to another department.,mixed
Now I work in KYC which is which is more interesting than support personally for me.,internal
So this is the success I believe that I have achieved and everybody in the office really praised me that I am the first to get the promotion very early in the job.,mixed
And I was warmly welcomed by the KYC department as well.,mixed
So that was my mini success in this office.,mixed
In my situation right now as a student as well this job is a perfect match so I am able to balance my studies and job along.,mixed
"Yes, I have more I would say desires to grow better on this position because as a human you always want to grow.",internal
I would not say this is the ideal situation where I have to be here all the time.,internal
"No, I really want to grow.",internal
The current situation is perfect for me.,internal
"Yes, in my company there are many people who are not native Russians.",mixed
They are from different parts of the world.,mixed
"Some are from Indonesia, some are from India, some are from Spain.",mixed
"So there are many nationalities within the company and the majority of people in the company speak Russian, but when they are talking to us they start speaking English.",mixed
"This environment is more welcoming, more comforting.",mixed
"They do not completely neglect you, even in meetings they really try to speak English.",mixed
"I really like this supportive environment and since every corporate company has events, they also celebrate events.",mixed
They don't keep their employees as excluded but they get along them.,mixed
"So, I'm speaking too much but yes, it’s a really supportive environment.",mixed
I believe that the support that the Russian people and the Russian culture corporate environment has given us is admirable really.,internal
With other company?,mixed
I mean it's been quite more than a year for me they are like my another family.,mixed
I talked to them.,mixed
"She always comes close and welcomes me, and there Shusha - she hugs me every time.",mixed
"Whenever we cross each other they warmly welcome me, they talk to me friendly.",mixed
When it comes to tasks which we perform on daily basis these tasks are assigned in a way that everybody does the job perfectly and also their report is in English.,mixed
"I don't know if it answered the question you have asked, but recently I asked my company to arrange an internship in the management department for my degree course.",mixed
"They were so kind and they were so supportive, they made this collaboration with the university and designed an internship for me for in the event management department.",mixed
"That's where I think I should appreciate them, that they agree to collaborate with the university and with the company, so there's an opportunity for a good collaboration within the company.",internal
"Since yes, this job is comfortable, easy and interesting as well but there is also I would say a negative point that in this job I am doing same task again, and again.",internal
"No, I don't hate my job to be honest, I appreciate the environment: is so friendly, so good, so comforting, so calm, and so supportive.",internal
"So I have never hated my job, I enjoyed it.",mixed
"Yes, some shifts are so early that at some times I'm tired or I'm sleepy.",mixed
"Apart from that I don't hate my job, I'm comfortable at this job.",mixed
That's a huge difference in what you feel now.,mixed
I like my country.,internal
I was working as a support agent and I was under so much pressure.,mixed
We worked nine hours straight without a single break.,mixed
They used to give us like half an hour break for just eating.,mixed
I just don't want to use that word...,internal
They just want employees to work all day without breaks.,mixed
"In Pakistan where I worked before it was not a good environment, the payment was not good and the behavior was not also good from the management side, they can insult you anytime.",mixed
"In Pakistan they always wanted boys to be the higher position because all the managers were boys, all the trainers were boys and men.",mixed
Pakistan is already a male dominant country.,mixed
"That company is not a small company in Pakistan, it's such a big company, it’s in a major city, in the middle of the city Iberks and it's in Karachi, so it's a huge company, but the environment was the worst and I was totally shocked when I saw the environment here in St. Petersburg, so that's a huge difference.",mixed
In my company it depends on what position you are so in.,mixed
In my position I do not have such powers to make any decision.,mixed
I have powers to make small decision for the customers.,mixed
"I believe language barrier, although they do speak English.",mixed
"They converse many times with us in English, but when you are in a certain environment where rest of people are speaking Russian and you don't understand, you feel isolated.",mixed
Also I believe at certain point that they might not give any foreigner the highest position.,internal
They will not give the top management level position to the foreigners.,mixed
"This is the difference, although I have not applied.",mixed
I'm interested.,internal
I've seen that they face a struggle and they have to be very careful about everything they do.,mixed
"Whatever is happening at the back you don't understand anything until you go and ask, so this is the challenge.",mixed
I believe at a certain point they might not give any.,internal
"It is not rule, it is just if they apply, they might consider it.",mixed
"It is my opinion, that there is something you learn from the environment.",internal
"Those things are not on the pages and not in the rules, but you just learn from one to one conversation.",mixed
I am proud that I got this opportunity very early since I came back here and performed very well on a customer agent job and then I shifted to another department and learned everything within two weeks.,internal
I was able to perform on the same level with other employees who were working for two to three years.,mixed
"And I came to that position within two weeks so, it was achievement for me.",internal
I was really proud on myself.,internal
"My numbers, my performance number, my QA scores - everything improved and I became comfortable.",external
I am also proud that I mingled with the whole team quickly.,internal
I didn't have a problem.,mixed
My country needs to improve a lot in the corporate culture.,mixed
They have to work on the way they run the companies.,mixed
"I don't have any questions but thank you so much for having me and good luck, thank you.",mixed
Hello.,mixed
Can you hear me?,mixed
"Yeah, I'm working.",mixed
I actually started to work several weeks ago.,mixed
I suppose the main thing is new experience.,mixed
I'm just very excited about new things and work.,internal
"New tasks, new projects, I have an opportunity to solve some new challenges I faced.",mixed
"And of course, I was very excited to meet new people at this place of work.",internal
I suppose that the main key thing is transparency of work process.,mixed
"I'm not sure how it's called, but I will explain it to you.",mixed
"I just can sit and observe my part in the whole project, like my part of responsibilities.",mixed
"I had to achieve the whole success, the whole task and that makes me feel good.",external
I'm not sure what do you mean by this question about my role.,mixed
Do you mean my role at the workplace?,mixed
"Yeah, I mostly like data analytics.",internal
"I just had to analyze a lot of separate pieces of information and combine them in some reports, in Excel tables and present them to my colleagues.",mixed
"Frankly speaking, the most appealing thing is that it's not me who takes responsibility for the main decisions of the main direction of the company.",mixed
"I mean, when we are doing the project, we have in our command quite a strict hierarchy.",mixed
"And I suppose I'm just in the lowest part of this, because I'm a newcomer.",mixed
"That's why I only prepare some materials, observe some databases and still it's not me who's making really key decisions which can be really important and stressful.",mixed
So I'm kind of a chill guy.,mixed
I suppose it will help me improve my analytical skills.,internal
"I mean, during my master's degree I've got some theoretical knowledge about this, but I've never applied it to a real case.",mixed
"And now I have an opportunity, so I'm quite happy with it.",internal
"I suppose it's really difficult for the company to achieve successful company culture, because it's kind of a balance between some empathy relation between colleagues and discipline.",internal
"So, understanding that you are at work and you are doing some functions.",mixed
"Actually, I'm not sure how I should answer this question.",internal
You have to ask other people rather than me.,mixed
Nothing about me surprises me.,internal
Actually I can name a schedule of working.,mixed
"I suppose it's my first time when I work in a strict schedule company, we really work from 9 a.m. till 6 p.m.",mixed
"And I get really tired after work when I come home, it's quite exhausting to work all day in one building, in one office.",mixed
I'm not really used to this still.,internal
"Yeah, that company is related to international relations and my bachelor’s degree is in international relations.",mixed
"I'm really happy to see the connections with my primary education, like it was not useless for me.",internal
"Actually, I think that I have become a bit more disciplined.",internal
"I really try to get some useful habits to set up my routine, like morning routine or some good habits for health, for, I don't know, studying and repetition.",mixed
"Actually, continuing the last answer, it would be logical to say that it's important to do some small things every day to achieve success.",mixed
"But actually, my real professional career and the process of getting my job position or what I'm doing right now is sometimes you need to be just in right place in right time.",mixed
"Okay, actually, I suppose it's also connected to my professional work, professional position, because when I came first time in the company I'm currently working at, I was judged.",internal
I came there with another major in university and my future boss wasn't expecting me to have more skills than it should be according to my first major.,mixed
But then they discovered that I'm a bit more skilled than they really expected.,mixed
And that's why I suppose I'm useful for them.,mixed
"Actually, when I was in the first year of my Bachelor's degree, I was thinking about opening a bar with my friend, but I'm not really sure that it's a really good idea at the time.",mixed
"But still, probably someday, maybe.",mixed
"Definitely not to open a bar, I suppose.",internal
"Just working and probably getting PhD, continuing my education, but I'm not really sure if it's going to be one year or maybe two years, five years probably.",mixed
I don't really know actually because I really don't have some goals or plans coming to the top place when I'm working at now.,mixed
That's why I can't clearly see my future plans.,mixed
I just know that I suppose in a year I will change the company but I'm still not sure if I will change the whole direction I'm working at.,mixed
"If I want to, maybe find a new profession, maybe I will still keep going in the same direction.",mixed
I'm not really sure about it.,mixed
"Be distant and responsible, and quite careful with details.",mixed
But it's only about my position now.,external
I'm not sure what qualities will be expected from me if I will move to higher positions to continue my career path.,external
Some YouTube videos of school students who are showing how to use Excel and how I should correctly formulate the formulas to set up filters in the file.,mixed
"I suppose all of you mentioned before: kindness, empathy and humor, all of them create a good microclimate in the department.",external
That's really nice that I have all these characteristics in my own department and as a newcomer I feel quite comfortable with people I communicating now.,internal
The best way for me is communicating during some small breaks with a cup of tea and sweets or cakes.,internal
The most pleasurable time.,mixed
"I'm quite sensitive to critics, frankly speaking.",external
"That's why when I got some comments from my senior colleagues, I just try to keep calm and memorize all they mentioned, making some notes and if it's possible for me to change I will change.",external
"I try not to give some strict comments myself because I suppose my position in the company is quite low, I just can give some suggestions to improve something, especially in my area.",internal
Or discuss some sources to get some data for analysis and so on.,mixed
"But it's not really critical because all the work I will discuss, I will do personally, so like it's suggesting for myself.",internal
"First, I've heard that I'm quite responsible and despite that my job interview was not really successful.",external
"My senior colleagues told me that they got me to work because of some analytical skills I have, hard skills are important.",external
It depends on the type of task.,mixed
"If a task requires some creativity, it's of course much better to do it in a format of brainstorming or generating ideas with the whole team.",external
I really don't have many conflicts with co-workers now.,mixed
"Because of the huge age gap between me and my co-workers it's difficult for me to clearly communicate with them, that's why I probably would like to run away from the conflict.",mixed
I suppose the power of new technologies.,mixed
"Actually, despite everyone believing that it isn’t bad for them to have some soft style management, I personally prefer to work with some strict and maybe sometimes tough manager because they articulate their requirements quite clear.",internal
You understand what you have to do and what they want from you.,mixed
Can I ask a question?,mixed
What means starting out?,mixed
I’m not sure.,mixed
"Actually to be patient and not to be afraid of some small challenges or like cringey moments, they will happen anyway.",mixed
"Yesterday, when I threw an unfinished table.",mixed
How does my decision-making process look like?,mixed
"As for my personal decision-making process, it's like a small thought analysis in my head.",internal
"I mean, comparing some advantages and disadvantages and based on them I just can make some decisions.",internal
With the help of discipline.,mixed
"Actually, it depends on people I communicate with, but now I'm mainly introvert because I am faced with a lot of new things in my daily life, like communication with new people.",mixed
"That's why, that all makes me a bit more shy and confused.",mixed
"Thank you, Albek.",mixed
It’s a pleasure to speak with you.,mixed
Oyu Tolgoi is a unique place to work because it blends traditional Mongolian values with the standards of an international company.,mixed
"The mining industry plays a critical role in our economy, and we take great pride in our contribution.",mixed
"At the same time, we’re encouraged to be proactive, share ideas, and continuously learn.",mixed
This dynamic mix of tradition and modernity makes Oyu Tolgoi a unique and inspiring place to work at.,mixed
"Hierarchy is important in Mongolia, but it’s not as rigid as people might think.",mixed
"We respect our elders and those in higher positions, but we also value open communication and inclusiveness.",mixed
"For example, junior employees are encouraged to observe and learn from experienced colleagues, but we’re also given chances to contribute ideas.",mixed
"Decisions are often made through consensus, emphasizing harmony and mutual respect.",mixed
This approach helps.,mixed
"Absolutely, relationships are the backbone of our work culture.",mixed
"We often strengthen bonds through shared meals, tea breaks, and social gatherings.",mixed
"Mongolian hospitality is deeply rooted in our culture, so inviting a colleague for a meal or tea is a way to show respect and build trust.",mixed
"This personal connection makes collaboration smoother and more effective, as people are more willing to help and support each other.",mixed
"Over time, this culture of mutual respect creates a sense of belonging and loyalty that extends beyond the workplace.",mixed
"Strong leadership in Mongolia means being approachable, supportive, and respectful.",mixed
"Leaders are expected to understand their team’s needs, motivate them, and lead by example.",mixed
"It’s common to see leaders participating in team activities, which helps break down hierarchies and fosters mutual respect.",mixed
"Compared to more hierarchical cultures, Mongolian leaders often balance authority with humility and a personal touch.",mixed
This approach encourages employees to be proactive and take ownership of their work while feeling supported.,mixed
We take work-life balance very seriously at Oyu Tolgoi.,mixed
"The company promotes flexible schedules, family support programs, and recreational activities to help employees recharge.",mixed
"For those working on-site, a rotation system of 21 days on-site followed by 14 days off ensures adequate rest and quality time with family.",mixed
"This system minimizes burnout and keeps morale high, which ultimately improves productivity.",mixed
"The company also offers wellness programs, including mental health support and stress management workshops.",mixed
"Working in the mining industry can be challenging due to long shifts, remote locations, and the demanding nature of the job.",mixed
"Oyu Tolgoi prioritizes safety, providing extensive training and safety protocols.",mixed
"The company also focuses on mental well-being, offering counseling services and stress management programs.",mixed
"To address professional challenges, employees have access to continuous learning, leadership training, and career development opportunities.",mixed
This support system helps employees thrive in a demanding environment.,mixed
"Mongolian work culture is distinctive in its emphasis on personal relationships, trust, and flexibility.",mixed
"Unlike the more formal and hierarchical structure often seen in Russian work culture, Mongolian workplaces tend to be more informal, and communication flows more freely.",mixed
"Building trust is essential, and relationships often start with personal connections.",mixed
"Mongolians value open dialogue, and decision-making often considers the input of the entire team.",mixed
This collaborative and adaptive approach sets Mongolia apart from its neighbors.,mixed
"Yes, one memorable moment was during a company event when a foreign manager tried Mongolian wrestling, a traditional sport.",mixed
"Although he didn’t win, it was a great icebreaker, and everyone had a good laugh.",mixed
"Events like these are common, where we celebrate traditional customs and bond as a team.",mixed
"These moments bring out the lighter side of work, helping us connect on a personal level.",mixed
It’s amazing how cultural exchange can strengthen our work relationships.,mixed
"Some people think Mongolians are reserved and hard to approach, but we are actually warm, friendly, and welcoming.",mixed
"Building trust may take time, but once established, relationships are deep and genuine.",mixed
"There’s also a misconception that Mongolia’s work environment is unstructured or lacks professionalism, which isn’t true.",mixed
"We value hard work, integrity, and innovation, and the work environment is dynamic and focused on results.",mixed
Oyu Tolgoi is committed to supporting local communities through sustainable development.,mixed
"We invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects, often collaborating with local partners.",mixed

"Be open-minded, adaptable, and genuinely interested in building relationships.",mixed
"Respect for local customs, such as hospitality and modesty, goes a long way.",mixed
Mongolians appreciate sincerity and genuine effort to understand the culture.,mixed
Learning a few basic Mongolian phrases can also create a good impression.,mixed
Embrace the experience—you’ll find Mongolia’s work culture rewarding and enriching.,mixed
"My pleasure, Albek!",mixed
I’m glad to share Mongolian work culture with you.,mixed
It’s been great discussing how our traditions shape the way we work and live.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
Okay.,mixed
"So my previous position is the call center operator, and I was on the outgoing calls.",mixed
A computer assistant gave me the phone numbers with a short description of what was already agreed upon in the previous calls.,mixed
And then I would call people and either try to solve their problems or sell them something.,mixed
"I mean, selling was the main point.",mixed
It's the biggest phone and TV and network operator in my country,mixed
They have call centers.,mixed
"They do a lot of business with the government and when I was working there, there was a different section.",mixed
So I was on the outgoing calls.,mixed
We had different campaigns that we would have to do.,mixed
"And then there were the incoming calls, I didn't work there because you need experience.",mixed
There was technical support where I also didn't work because I didn't have the qualifications.,mixed
In Slovenia.,mixed
"Yeah, there was a period, but I think it was really short.",mixed
"It's government owned company, so the working standards are normal.",mixed
It was basically some sort of limited hours per week contract.,mixed
"I didn't have really a lot of rights, so even the probation period didn't make sense because they could fire me at any time.",mixed
After one month I was just trained basically.,mixed
I could start maybe not even one month.,mixed
It was like two weeks and I was already making some simple phone calls and that's it basically.,mixed
"I have a friend who was my coworker, but we were equals, but I relied on him for information.",external
But then I had direct managers.,mixed
"There were actually two, and one of them was the de facto manager.",mixed
"He was there for years and he knew everything, but he was just passed over for all the advancements, I dunno, career progression.",mixed
"And then we had this boss, she was basically working under him.",mixed
"And then because she has this bossy personality, she got upgraded into the boss.",mixed
"Officially, yeah.",mixed
"If you have any kind of qualification, it quickly kills your brain because it's just, the challenge is not there.",mixed
So that was the challenge.,mixed
"The challenge was not even like the salary, but the lack of any kind of progression because you knew that there was this gap between the managerial positions and everyone else.",mixed
And then there was this leader of the whole call center.,mixed
And above him there was the leader of all the call centers in the country.,mixed
"This was regional or middle management, we didn't understand what they were doing.",mixed
"For example, they demanded more time on call and less time doing other things.",mixed
But sometimes this couldn't be done because how do you call it?,mixed
"Like if you wanna fill some documentation or something, this would destroy your statistics.",mixed
But doing documentation was also kind of expected and demanded of us.,mixed
"So the reports, you had to add these sales and make the sale, which would take like some time.",mixed
That would kill your statistics because then you would have like less time on call.,mixed
"Because these bosses, they didn't know the reality of call centers.",mixed
They would see some sort of goals and they would try to improve the sales statistics and the productivity.,mixed
But the result was that always like they found some sort of way to basically cheat at it.,mixed
And hat was one thing.,mixed
"This lack of career progress because you knew that the people who are the managers, they didn't start from the call center probably.",mixed
"It's kind of pretty, I don't know, it was pretty bad.",mixed
"And then maybe also some sort of like, yeah, I dunno like a lot of things, but not really important I guess.",mixed
"There had been, because it's a state owned company, so you have a lot of these women that are like...",mixed
"Yeah, then they are just there and they don't really care so much about doing a good job.",mixed
"Because their job is in no way threatened and they are protected under labor standards and they they just chill and sometimes they are rude, sometimes they are silly.",mixed
Managers?,mixed
I don't know.,internal
For me it was weird that this guy that actually acted like he knew everything and all these weird details.,internal
"Like yeah, 10 years ago we were moving the database from one system to the other and there is this bug in the system and you can lavoid it by doing this and that.",mixed
"And it's one of these like one in 10,000 cases that he just knew because of his experience, but he was always friendly and like, kind of because of that.",mixed
"And for me, this was kind of weird because I think he was a good manager and he really knew everything, but they didn't let him progress.",internal
Like some other people did.,mixed
"But I don't know, like maybe that was the weirdest part.",mixed
"But because  it's government owned, you have good protection rights, you get paid on time, they don't exploit you for extra hours because legally they can't.",mixed
"So I dunno, goofy.",mixed
"Yeah, they basically, I don't know, because of the unions, the standards were really high.",mixed
"So if you are employed there, now the working conditions are really good, like judging from my ex-colleagues, salaries are high and uh, compensation and they have paid leave.",mixed
"And a lot of leave, a lot of sick leave, a lot of everything, they offer you education, so on.",mixed
So yeah.,mixed
Good.,mixed
Money.,mixed
"I mean, simply because I wanted to save the money and I also knew that on the job market, if you don't have the qualifications, it's difficult.",mixed
"So I think on the scale of these jobs that the students can do, it was a really good job because you had some sort of inducements.",internal
"Because you don't sell a lot of phones, but if you, I don't know, they adjusted them based on something in some months they were set unfairly basically.",mixed
"Um, yeah.",mixed
"But more or less the money and knowing that there are a lot of worse works, for example, this is relatively intellectual, you just have to like, you know, be friendly.",mixed
"But for example, you could also work in some cafe and they wouldn't pay you.",mixed
And this nightmare would be nightmarish.,mixed
I think that at this level there are no decisions per se.,internal
"Because for example, the decisions are like, sometimes there are some cases like for example the business or something and you just have to forward them because at this level, the business process is so streamlined that it is not your job, you forward to people who are responsible.",mixed
"You don't really, it's more like lack of training.",mixed
"As I was saying, these extreme cases of having to do something in some old database or something that someone would tell you, but no decisions.",mixed
"These people, you just like kind of skipped them, although it was not really legal under the company's terms.",mixed
Yeah.,mixed
"My usual morning days, it depends.",mixed
"Usually I was working another job in the morning, then I would have some lunch and come in the afternoon.",mixed
The good thing was that the lunch leave was paid.,mixed
"It's not like in Russia, you basically work nine hours, but it's eight hours.",mixed
"I think they are friendly people, of course they are beautiful people.",internal
"I think even for their males also, they are friendly.",internal
"Sometimes you may see them and feel like, is this person really friendly?",mixed
"But really I think once you get to know them and you become a little bit friends with them, you know that they can do a lot of things for you.",mixed
"Hello, my name is Deepak and I am a student of Masters in International Business Management.",mixed
I am from India and I have been also working here for a Russian company as a contract support executive.,mixed
"So yeah, whatever you need I am ready to help.",mixed
Thank you.,mixed
"So, basically since I am from India, the company was looking some Indian to get their work done.",mixed
"So, I applied to a lot of companies and then I got the interview and I successfully cleared the interview.",mixed
"So, my work is basically like bridging a gap between my company and clients.",mixed
"So, before having any equipment sold, we have a lot of documents work which we need to go through thoroughly one by one.",mixed
"So, lot of paperwork, documents, then there are a lot of clients, sometimes they get angry, but sometimes they don't get angry.",mixed
"So, I need to convince them, sometimes on their behalf I need to explain something to the company.",mixed
"So yeah, it is a bit challenging and takes a lot of time and energy, but still I enjoy it.",internal
"So, it is a good job.",mixed
"Yeah, I love it because every time I need to consult with new people and every time when I consult with new people, it is a new experience.",internal
"Because everyone has a different way of working, perspective, dealing with things.",mixed
"So, every time I find something challenging and new to work or explore to learn something.",mixed
"So, I love it.",internal
"The most I enjoy about my work is when I close the deal, when I get the satisfaction.",internal
"You know, after months of work, when I am successfully able to complete everything, all the paperwork, this part is the most satisfying for me.",mixed
"Okay, now I can close the file and I did something, I achieved something.",mixed
I managed to meet the demands of lot of people to make them agree on something.,mixed
"Then I feel like okay, I am doing something, I am achieving something.",internal
"So, my day typically starts at 8 and it takes around one hour for me to get to the office.",mixed
"And then when I get to the office, I check my mail, if I have received some important mail first.",mixed
Then I will check them one by one and answer them in order to whatever documents are required.,mixed
If I need to schedule some meeting for tomorrow or something like this video meeting.,mixed
"And then I will go to my regular part of the work, I will check my clients in order.",mixed
"So, yeah, hopefully I am satisfied with my work.",internal
"I can do much more, but I am satisfied and I am constantly learning something new.",internal
"I think I take my work very seriously, whatever I do.",internal
That's how I think of it.,internal
Secret to productivity.,mixed
It can be different.,mixed
In my opinion can differ from others.,internal
But the secret for productivity is to explain and make your brain or mind understand that there is no easy ways to progress.,internal
So if your mind connects and picks that up it will push you to work hard and along with finding smart ways to do hard work.,internal
So.,mixed
"But if you explain to your brain that it can be done, it will be done.",internal
The leadership is autocratic.,mixed
1 dialect.,mixed
Very hard.,mixed
"Very hard, yes.",mixed
No.,mixed
"Yes, but I think Democratic is better than that.",internal
"We had a manager before who was people oriented, so his leadership style was the best and he's really appreciated by everyone unless the one who is current who is very strict.",mixed
"Yes, I have worked with diverse people.",mixed
So I have done some tasks where I had to do work with international people.,mixed
So everyone is helpful and I have been fortunate enough to share experiences with them and share some time with them.,mixed
"People oriented, like put your trust in me and I will produce result.",external
"Very quick learner, very quick.",mixed
"No, like I just like provide me training and I want to do not stories or visual representation.",internal
Just provide me to the point basic training and I will go for it.,mixed
"Professionally, it's like previous month I lost $2000.",mixed
"I took a risk in business, in crypto business, I invested in some crypto coins and I lost value.",mixed
"And then I got an experience that it is basically to rob poor people, poor people like us.",mixed
The risk was not very good for me.,mixed
"But thinking about it professionally in a business, if I would have invested in some stocks, I would have researched about it, whether to buy it or not.",mixed
Life is my career.,mixed
"I will advise him to just be patient and keep working hard, not find ways to cut corners or cut time just to get early at home or waste time.",mixed
"So I would advise that be patient, work hard and it will produce results for you.",mixed
Working smart because sometimes it can get you better results than your colleagues.,mixed
"He has worked the same way as four others, but in the eyes of the manager or the owner this guy is attached to me and stuff.",mixed
Maybe produce an advantage or work smarter.,mixed
Find a short way to achieve that result in better time.,mixed
I don't stay organized.,mixed
"Simple answer, like I say, very disorganized.",mixed
But in the office I stay organized because people are watching.,external
So the answer to the question is that if people are watching then I stay organized.,external
Very big extrovert.,mixed
It's because I am very emotionally expressive.,mixed
I make friends very easily.,mixed
I'm a friendly type of person.,mixed
"Anybody can talk to me about anybody and I enjoy learning about them and their lives, what is going on.",mixed
