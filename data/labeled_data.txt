How are you?---non
Alright, I'm alright, I'm alright.---non	
What's up?---non
So I am a creative lead when it comes to content strategy and content generation and content marketing.---non
I also do a lot of marketing services, digital marketing.---non
I also do events, both BTL and ATL.---non
When I say ATLI I mean campaigns, I run campaigns on digital mediums and in a BTLI do underground events, marketing campaigns, events and all of that.---non
Also I mean sports management agency work, specifically football.---non
These things, yes.---non	
So basically my business is pursue my passion.---int
So I'm passionate about them.---int
I give it my 100%.---int
I enjoy doing them.---int	
Wow.---non
So yes, for marketing campaigns, for instance, I'll just limit it to marketing campaigns.---non	
So marketing campaigns, we have metrics, we have KPI, for instance, we measure the reach, we measure the experiential.---ext
So for instance, if you are talking digital marketing campaigns, you are talking about your reach, you are talking about the engagement you are able to generate online	and then you are also talking about the participation.---ext	
You know how many people participated the effectiveness of the campaign.---ext	
So your KPI is basically would be centered around the participation, would be centered around the reach and then would also be centered around how much of the experience the people who who participated enjoyed.---ext
I mean, if you can have some sort of talkability around the campaign, you can't really gauge talkability.---non	
But if you have 6 out of 10 people online talking about your campaign means you know you've achieved a particular goal.---ext
Well, yes, so my probationary Pro is basically was premised on my ability to deliver.---ext	
And then also, you know, consistency in, in my excellence.---int
When I say excellence, I mean the, the, the kind of the quality of the, of the output you are given.---non
So I would also give you an example.---non
For instance, during your probationary prod, you are asked to come up with a campaign for a particular product.---non
OK, now you are supposed to get X amount of reactions or you're supposed to get X amount of sampling.---non
If it's a BTO, you go on the ground, you sample the product, it's a new product you are bringing up, you are coming up to.---non	
So you are given X amount of sampling, you are given X amount of feedback you are supposed to generate and all of that.---non
So during my probationary report, I was given targets to meet and then I was able to achieve them.---int
Without meeting these targets, I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to be retained as an employer.---non	
So basically that's how my provisional product went.---non
And then also my in office activities, how I was relating with my fellow workers.---non
I mean, you could you could have the best output, you could have the best attitude towards your work, you could deliver the best result.---ext	
But if you are not impacting or you are not generally given a good feeling in the office, you wouldn't really be retained.---ext
So yes, in as much as you are performing on the job, you also have to try as much as possible to make sure you are at peace with those you are working with, you are playing well in in the team and all of that.---ext
So yes, those are the some of the factors that.---non
Well, I didn't mix.---non	
OK, so first of all, I understood that I was in the office for work and anybody I see around is a coworker or is there basically for work.---non
OK, but I'm human and there are some traits, some good traits you'd like to learn from your supervisors.---ext	
So I kept it formal when I had to keep it formal.---non	
And then I went in formal when you know the mood or the situation called for it.---int	
For instance, I couldn't be formal when that the person was in a bad mood or the person had suffered a terrible loss.---ext	
I couldn't go formal.---non
OK.---non
I had to be a bit sympathetic towards the situation and be a bit informal, go out of my way to offer some sort of sympathy to the person.---ext	
And then also there were happy times in their life that they would have loved to celebrate it.---non
I couldn't go formal.---non
I couldn't say, Oh no, we are just coworkers.---non
I can't just see you in the office and let it go.---non	
You had to reach out.---ext
You had to try and be human.---ext	
So yes, I did a mix of both the formal and the informal approaches to towards my supervisors, yeah.---int
Can't say you dislike, but I think sometimes it gets difficult.---int
Sometimes you get a brain drain, you get a creative block.---non	
You know, you need to come up with a new thing, you need to come up with a new strategy, you need to come up with a new concept.---int	
And it seems you have exhausted all the creativity in your head, OK, And your clients are waiting, your bosses are waiting for the next wow factor.---ext	
So sometimes you get very difficult trying to get inspiration, especially when you are locked up in an office and being a creative.---non	
You need the environment to sort of give you some sort of inspiration.---ext
When you are locked up in an office, it becomes very difficult for you to get the inspiration.---ext
So I think that's, that's the only problem I have with my job.---int
Brain, brain, a brain block, a creative stall and all of that.---non
That is the only problem aside that I enjoy everything that comes with the stress, the trail, the uncertainty is about campaign, how well would go and all of that.---int
It's, it's beautiful.---int
Well, like I mentioned it later on, it's basically my passion.---int
So I'm just chasing a passion and then I'm just trying to make money out of it.---int
So I wasn't influenced by a person, Percy.---int	
I was just influenced by my intrinsic motivation, what I wanted to do.---int
I sat down, did some sort some self introspection, and then I just decided to follow my passion and then try as much as possible to monetize it.---int	
So yeah, I'm just inspired by myself and what I believe I can achieve in the creative space.---int
Man, of course.---non
So I, I would always, you know, take you back to me being creative, being creative, you need to be as balanced as possible because you get inspired by the environment.---ext
You get inspiration from the environment.---ext	
So you never know where you could find the next inspiration, right?---ext	
So you try as much as possible to keep it balanced.---non
You don't, you don't, you're not so much into the job, yes, as your passion.---non
You're supposed to be serious about it, but you need to know when to take a break.---int	
So I enjoy life with my family, my niece especially and my mum.---int
I take breaks sometimes.---non	
I sleep a lot as well.---non
I spend time, I try to spend quality time with my family.---non	
I don't, I don't make my life all about work, work, work, work.---int
No, I balance it properly.---int
I spend time with my family.---non
I take them out sometimes, we have dinners sometimes, we take a walk sometimes, and we have sleep insurance.---non
Sometimes we all gather and then have fun and sleep.---non
Yeah.---non
So that's our balance.---non
My.---int
OK, so I believe as a team player that to each has to it his or her strength or her area of expertise, right?---int
So I believe in team playing a lot.---int	
And I believe that each person is blessed with, let me say superior knowledge or superior know how in particular areas of this space we found our ourselves in.---int
So our decision making basically is generic - we make decisions as a team.---ext	
OK, So I don't, I don't impose decisions on people.---non	
I don't impose things on my fellow workers.---non	
We sit down, we have a conversation as a team.---non
We try to judge on so the judge on them.---non	
We try to figure out how best we can, you know, solve things or we can go about things.---non
And then we try as much as possible to also adopt best practices elsewhere.---non
So like I said, people have superior knowledge or, or technical know how when it comes to some things.---ext
I am not all knowing like I'm not all doing as well.---int
I believe in delegating and delegating efficiently.---int
So within the team there are people who are very competent with some things.---non	
We sit down, we pick their minds on particular areas of expertise and then we make a decision as a team.---ext	
OK, so the idle work environment for us as creatives is not making people feel small in their box, making every person responsible for whichever activity he or she has been assigned to.---int
So for me as as a superior or as a boss, I try to make people boost their morale up every time have them, you know, conceive positive mindset towards each and every assignment	they are given.---non
We also motivate staff who, you know, I found one thing in some areas, we also try to educate them.---non
We also try to empower them in a way.---non
So the atmosphere in this office or in this company is more of a +1 is you can do it kind of thing.---non
You can do it spirit and then teamwork.---non
So we do we solve problems as a team.---ext
We have fun as a team.---non
We suffer as a team.---non	
We take hits and losses, though.---non	
I'm the boss.---int
I take, you know, the major part of it, but that kind of what's it called the familial kind of thing, that kind of feeling that we have here.---non	
We, we approach everything as a team and as a family.---non
So that is the kind of spirit we have here, the team spirit, team morale and then inspiring each other, challenging each other, positive, you know, healthy competition in here.---non 
That's the kind of attitude.---non	
We accept here or we have conceived in this company.---non
Wow.---non
For me personally, are you asking for me personally?---int
Oh well, my again as a critic, my day starts when I feel there's for for instance, so when I feel there is a lot of things to do, I come into the office very early, sometimes at six AMI try to sign off what I need to sign off.---int
I try to take meetings that I'm supposed to take and then I try to delegate each assignment to whoever I believe is the most competent.---int
OK, so that is normally how my day goes.---non	
If I do not have a lot of paperwork to do, I step out and then I try to supervise projects that have been done.---non
I try to keep an eye on every project that has been done, for instance, like shoes, like campaigns, like events.---int	
I go around supervising and then making sure everything is in place.---non
If there is no such thing, I just hit the playground with my children and then my nieces and then we have a good time and I also and treat my staff to take time off and then spend some time with family or spend some time doing what they enjoy doing.---non
Well, my role for now, we won the best African film from the Cannes Digital awards.---non
Cannes, I'm not sure.---non
I'm sure you know what Cannes says.---int
Cannes is a film awarding scheme or whatever.---non
He based in France.---non
So that's our latest award for a movie, a short film that we did based around tourism and then patriotism.---non	
So that is our most recent award.---non
But then we have, you know, gotten a couple of awards.---non
I wouldn't say that to Brad, but we have got him quite a number of awards, which we are proud of as a team.---ext
We also look forward to, you know, raking in a few more awards just to feel good about ourselves.---ext
What do you do?---non
We are creative agencies.---non	
So anything creative, I would say we are creative alchemist.---int
OK.---non
So anything when it comes to content generation like movies, like short films, like commercial TV commercials, like digital contents, when it comes to static graphics and then you know, moving graphics and all of that.---non
We also do a bit of advertising.---non	
We also do a bit of media buying, so radio media buying, TV media buying.---non	
We do marketing as well.---non	
We devise marketing strategy.---non	
We do marketing campaigns, we do marketing events as well.---non	
And then we also do sports management, so specifically in football agencies.---non
So we are licensed FIFA agents.---non
If we sport the talent, we try to connect this talent with the best bid bidder just to you know, push the talent as far as this talent can go.---non
So this footballing talent can go.---non	
So that is that is the scope of our business.---non
That is what we do here.---non
Right.---non
So apprenticeship, I took time to be an apprentice.---non
I learned under the best that I know.---int
I also understood time.---int
I told myself that time edifies.---int	
So if you put in the time diligently, you will reap some good success at the end of it.---int
But I believe in apprenticeship and being mentored by people in whom you can find very positive traits.---int
So mentorship, apprenticeship and taking responsibility sometimes most of us really do not like to be held responsible, especially when things go South.---non	
But being responsible and learning how to take the hits, sometimes learning how to be points to what you are now kind of strengthens your character.---int	
So those are the three.---non
I mean, those are the ones that stand out, you know, practices that I have employed my whole life and it has brought me where I am. Subjecting yourself to apprenticeship, understanding how time works, taking responsibility for everything.---int
And then, you know, cultivating a very positive attitude everywhere, every time, being optimistic in every situation.---int
Yeah.---non
OK, so I obviously have 24 hours like everyone else, but I have a way of going about my things.---int
There's this theory that I used.---int	
Just hold on a SEC.---non	
I want to show you that.---int	
Yeah.---non
So basically what I do is I break my task into simpler ones, and then I try to take them off my schedule one at a time.---int
So for instance, if I know that I have so many meetings to take or I have so many things to accomplish, I take the easy ones.---non
I start with the easy ones.---non
Bit by bit I take them off my list.---non
And then when I am quite ready, when I've had lunch and I feel strong, I tackle the most difficult one.---int
So it's just breaking down your tasks into simple ones and then achieving them bit by bit?---non	
Bit by bit, yeah.---non
So that's how I manage my time.---int
Of course, of course, of course.---non	
OK, so first of all, in the creative space, the star is the sky is big enough for every star to shine.---non
OK, you don't have to do what everybody's doing.---int	
You can be your own unique self and you can just find the unique selling proposition for yourself and then you do it.---int
Second of all, passion without work is bullshit.---int
I'm sorry.---int
It's, it's nothing.---non
So in as much as you're passionate about something, you need to understand that you need to work hard towards it, cultivate healthy working attitude towards it, cultivate a positive working attitude towards it.---int
And then thirdly, it's teamwork and networking.---non
So you need to be a very good team player.---int	
You need to respect and understand that people are well talented in things that you are not.---ext
People can be better than you are at things and that's OK.---ext
You need to understand that people actually have an upper hand in some things that you do not have, and you have to try as much as possible to make them responsible for those things in order to push you.---int
OK, so you can, you know, go alone when you're alone.---int
But if you are in the team, you can go far and you can sustain properly.---non	
So yes, those are the things that I believe can be some sort of guiding principles for whoever wants to venture into this world.---int	
Well, I think working smart the hard way is what works for you.---int
I mean, you can't outsmart everything in your life.---non	
Sometimes you need to put in the work, sometimes you need to be a fool and raise true challenges to hard work.---non
But working smart also saves you a lot of time, which you can use to, you know, concentrate on other things.---non
So I think a healthy blend of both, you know, you went to work hard on something and then you know, you went to work smart on something.---int	
When you are able to blend both properly, I think you you'd achieve some, some sort of success.---int
You do?---non
Yeah.---non
Course, one thing I've learnt throughout my career is that communication ions out a lot of things and people who do not know how to communicate what they are thinking or how they feel often have issues in life.---int
So in my professional experience I have had, you know, sometimes where clients might have said they want this way, but it was communicated differently from their outfit.---non	
And we decided to go with their official communication and came out whoever is responsible, whoever is calling the shots didn't want it that way.---ext	
So I have tried as much as possible to always ensure we all align on one particular direct in one particular direction, that communication is clear, we know what exactly we are doing.---non
Secondly, like you mentioned, people management.---non	
People management also makes you learn that everybody's coming from a different background.---ext	
People are coming from different people have different view viewpoints about life.---non
People have different views about work.---non
People are coming from, you know, diverse places.---non	
So you try as much as possible to accommodate them.---ext	
And then I don't know if there's a right word, whip them in line towards the company vision and all of that.---ext
Because without the company, without the umbrella called company, you would never ever, I'm sure in your lifetime never meet those people.---non
So you try as much as possible to elevate the company's mission and vision above all personal experiences.---ext
And then you chase the company's mission and vision.---ext	
There will be problems.---non
Obviously there'll be conflict.---non
We are human.---non
There'll be conflicts on one or two times.---non	
As a manager, I try as much as possible to be fair and to be just.---int	
If you are wrong, I am going to tell you are wrong and you are going to suffer the consequences for being wrong.---int	
If you are right, I'm going to tell you are right.---int
But all in all, I try as much as possible to make everybody understand that we are all going in one direction.---non	
We are all going in one direction and we have to relegate our personal feelings, our personal experiences, everything to the background and to that particular life.---ext
Books, I have quite a number.---non
I've read a lot of books.---non
I don't really remember the titles, but I pick and, you know, I filter through some of the things that I can learn.---int
But one outstanding one for me is it made it made a profound impact.---non
It left a profound impression on me since the time I've read it, and I still read it today.---non	
Even this morning I read it that for that.---non	
Yeah.---non
I think it shapes your perspective of our life.---ext
It helps you understand that people might come from the same background but might have different opinions about things.---ext
People might be enjoying the same privileges but might have different opinions about life and different opinions about dreams and what is possible and what is not possible.---non	
So which that product?---non
Thank you, Sir.---non
Thank you so much.---non	
Thanks for having me.---non
Enjoy your day.---non
Hello, Ruizhou.---non
I'm Victoria.---non	
I'm Korea citizen.---non	
I came to Russia to study and after that I just find work in some company, Aurora Technology.---non
Now I study and work at the same time.---non
Well, I understand that it's being well done when all projects are submitted exactly on time and when clients are really satisfied.---ext	
For example, our last project creating a website for a client was completed two weeks ahead of the schedule and the client even left us a great review.---ext
Once again, please.---non	
How to make decisions?---ext
Mostly through analysing all sort of data and of course taking feedback from our team into account.---ext	
The last time we decided to which is purchasing campaign to launch, we really analysed all the previous campaigns and the team's opinions and choose the most promising option.---ext
You know this place where you can personally, you can be creative and work independently, just these.---int	
Ideal partner.---non
They need to be reliable, you know, and have a good reputation on the market, of course, like our recent supplier of companies for production who always meets deadlines exactly and offers us furball terms.---ext
Really comfortable guy to work with.---non
About vacation, yeah, we mostly works five to two, you know, five day works to the day offs.---non
Ideal, I just prefer not to work.---int	
It's ideal.---int	
Ideal one or what?.---non
Well, my day starts with checking my plan for the day and they're having meetings with the team.---non
When then I mostly work on the current task, like developing a new market strategy.---non
For example, recently I'm doing this after lunch.---non
I usually meet with clients or partners and in the end I just prepared reports of the day's results.---non
It was really interesting situation, really let me feel comfortable.---int	
Recently, I successfully completed initiations with a new supplier and we were able to reduce production cost by 10%.---non
That's you know important for our profitability in this quarter.---non
So if you're so good.---non
For now, I am working in a modern office right in the city center, which is comfortable to go there and there's a lot of lights, some modern stuff, enough space, that's all just comfortable situation.---non
We have some special workspace and some special have rest space, so it's very comfortable.---non
If you have some tough time, you need to have some mental rest.---int
You just go to have rest.---non
Company develops software for financial institutions.---non
We create applications which that help banks and insurance companies to make the year operations and improve customer service.---non
You know, for example, we recently launched a new app for mobile banking analysis analytics, and it's already being used by several major banks.---non	
Right now, I'm working in the department of the supplies of the gas project.---non
Yes.---non
Not really.---non
My department is international, so my colleagues are pretty friendly.---non
I see key indicators.---ext
First, I meet targets set by my supervisors, such as ensuring timely delivery of supplies and maintaining inventory levels.---ext
Also, receiving positive feedback from colleagues and stakeholders shows the accuracy of my work.---ext
When I complete my job, if I get positive feedback, I feel I have performed well.---ext
First, I look at different scenarios and their potential impacts on the supply chain.---non
I use data and past performances to inform decisions.---ext
I also discuss with team members and supervisors to align decisions with company goals.---ext
The ideal work environment would have clear and open communication, teamwork, opportunities for continuous learning, and access to the latest technology to streamline the supply chain.---non
Everyone has good and bad days, but we try our best.---non	
To tell the truth, I haven’t thought much about it.---non	
Usually, my day off involves going to the gym or seeing my girlfriend.---non	
My day starts by checking emails and updates from suppliers.---non
I ensure there are no immediate issues requiring attention, coordinate with my team to plan tasks, confirm delivery schedules, resolve logistical issues, and participate in meetings with other departments.---non
Two years.---non
Recently, I streamlined the supply chain process, reducing delivery times by 5% by implementing a new tracking system and improving communication with suppliers.---non
I try to do my best every day.---int
Every task, big or small, is an opportunity for growth.---non
Previously, decisions were based on feelings without clear leadership.---int
Now, our system is more hierarchical, with a directive style.---non
Feedback is encouraged to improve workflows.---non
Yes, I find this system effective.---int	
I’m comfortable as long as the company achieves its goals.---ext	
My company operates globally, specializing in oil and natural gas extraction and refinement.---non
We manage complex supply chains to ensure smooth operations, from sourcing raw materials to delivering products worldwide.---non
Our focus is on logistics, innovation, and sustainability.---non
Yes, we work closely with these countries and aim to strengthen future collaborations.---non
Okay.---non
It is my greatest pleasure to participate in the HSE university project.---non
So, let me do a brief introduction about myself.---non
My name is Anon.---non
I came from China.---non
My Chinese name is Anon.---non
Nowadays, I'm studying my Master's Degree in High School of Economics in Russia, St. Petersburg campus.---non
It is my greatest pleasure to illustrate anything related to the cultural code of China, because China is the country that I had been living for my entire life.---non
Around 20 years.---non
So I have my own perspectives around anything related to culture in China.---int
So maybe it will be somehow very different with most of the people's views, but I hope you can understand me very well, okay.---int
Yeah, currently.---non
Right now I am working full-time in a restaurant.---non
That restaurant was opened by Russian people, but it is a Chinese restaurant.---non	
The name of the restaurant is the Pisha Dynasty Ming, and that place previously was the museum of Joseph Brodsky and Alexander Brodsky, because Joseph Brodsky's favorite dish was the Chinese food.---non
You know, he was the greatest writer in the former Soviet Union.---non	
When he received the Nobel Prize of Literature, he was having Chinese food in a Chinese restaurant in the town street of London, something like this.---non	
Yes, because in HSE we have very demanding standards, you know, our professor asked all the foreign students to find interviews or a full-time job by themselves.---non	
For me, I was working as a Chinese social media marketing manager and doing all shifts in that restaurant.---non
Previously I never found a job by myself so this time I do realize that it is very difficult to make money on your own.---ext
So, I get to know that it is very important for me to save the money, because earn money isn't that easy.---ext
You know, money isn't a blood, but a vein or something like this.---non
Yes, yes, yes, yes.---non
I do like the company's atmosphere.---int
You know, there's quite a different the culture code between the companies in Russia and that in China.---non	
Russian companies are very tolerant to the newcomers.---non
Sometimes I make some very big mistakes.---non
I was scolded by my boss a lot and my employees a lot.---non
Sometimes, you know, I don't know the culture's code in the Russian company.---non
But it is worth to try to make mistakes because after you make mistakes, you start to realize that you shouldn't do such things.---non
For example, you shouldn't eat in an open space because it was quite impolite.---non
And also, when the customers go inside of the restaurant, it is necessary for them to take off their coats.---non
But in China, the Chinese restaurants won't work in this way.---non
Because in China, you know, we even don't have the wardrobe to put the clothes to.---non
Because in China, we don't have these customs.---npn
And we don't have some occupations to hire someone to put the customers closest to the rightest place, we don't have these occupations.---non
That's the main difference between the Russian restaurant and the Chinese restaurant.---non
And also, in the Russian restaurant, it is okay that if sometimes the customers give you some tips but in China no one is allowed to give tips to the workers.---non	
Because you know the Chinese people, in their opinion you work for this job, so you do the job that you were required to.---non	
And also, the boss sometimes forbids their employees to get some extra money from the customers because they think the customers should give all the money to the boss rather than to the employees.---non
The only way for the employees to receive money is from their boss, not from the customers.---non	
But in China, you know, the Chinese people they are actually kind of working overtime for free and all the Chinese people they get used to it.---non
So that's the main difference between the working environment from the western culture and the oriental culture.---non	
It was quite stressful and quite overloaded in the oriental countries, you know, it is very hard to get money.---non
But in the Western countries, you know, working as a waiter in restaurants was pretty fun.---int
You can get appreciation from your customers.---ext
And also, the tips, something like this.---non
Yes, I think the biggest motivation is that my boss, Anna, she provided me all the documents that was necessary to let me pass from the internships.---non
She provided all the documents of the company and also she let the general manager sign the contracts to me.---non	
She was pretty; she treated me pretty nice and also you know in my working place everyone is hard-working, but they are not, they are not competitive viciously.---non
You know in Chinese cultures in Chinese companies everyone kind of treats everyone around them as competitors.---non
But now in my working place everyone treats each other as a friend, as their important person.---non
They are kind, they help each other, even if sometimes someone gets higher salaries than them, they won't be journeyers.---non	
But in China, no.---non
If one of the employees has higher salaries than them, oh, they start to say some bad words to them, they kind of stab them in the back.---non	
That is very bad, you know, atmosphere in the Chinese company.---int
So, you know, a lot of people, they kind of don't want to work because they receive a lot of pressure for the relationships because some of the employees, they are jealous of them, they don't want them to have a good life, they don't want them to have good salaries, they kind of complain about them secretly and also say some bad words to them.---non
Let's note the colleagues.---non	
I really want to work in some place with really good colleagues rather than the competitors.---int
I don't want to get a high salary; I just want to do my job and give the best services to the customer.---int
I don't want to spend any time doing something that I think is useless for managing the relationship.---int
If this person really doesn’t like me, just doesn't talk with me.---non
Sometimes you know in China you have had to manage it.---non
You have had to spend more time on to managing the relationship.---non	
You know, if the relationship went bad in your working place, it would bring a lot of pressure and unhappiness to you, something like this.---non
Yes, because while I was a waiter in my working place, I really do like to have some small talk with the customers.---int
Even though I speak Russian so-so, they still don't think that I'm a very low employee.---non
They give me a lot of encouragement.---non
Actually, I was very surprised that all the Russian people are kind of speaking English very well.---int
So, it is true that the education level of Russian people is very high, it's higher than that in China.---non
You know while the customers were finishing their meal and they came to my place to pick up their clothes, I would like to say: hello, sir, «Было вкусно» , they would say: «Спасибо», and then I will say: «You are welcome to come here again».---non	
Some of my Russian customers really want to talk more with me about my experience, about their experience.---non
I would really like to, you know, talk with them.---int
And my boss was very surprised that I can manage the relationship between the customers and the company so good, because it is very necessary for us to build a long-term good relationship with the customers.---non
We call this CRM management, customers relationship management.---non
So, every time I was talking very with customers, Russian customers, my boss was very happy.---ext	
And every time I saw some Russian customers left some very good reviews to me on the ESS web of our restaurant I was so happy.---ext
Something like this.---non
Because it is a Russian restaurant, people never thought that they would hire Chinese people to make the culture here much more diverse, and people feel that I was very rare in the Russian restaurant and they can't stop to talk with me because they really want to speak with the foreigners.---non
I can see that the Russian people they treat everyone very good, very hospitable.---non	
Every time a lot of Russian people came to me, and they may have thought that I can't speak Russian very well and they talked with me using English very actively because they really want to know me and make friends with me.---non
Sometimes I get tips from them.---non
I feel really happy.---int
And also, some Russian customers, they can't speak English very well, but I can understand what they want me to do for them.---non
Oh, I don't know what they were talking about, but I know that I just give the clothes to them and let them pick up something from their pockets, because I can get to know what's their intentions from the same languages.---non
And sometimes they just want to smoke.---non	
I will tell them, there were some blankets by the doors.---non	
If you really want to go outside for cigarettes, you can pick up some blankets rather than your coat.---non
Something like this.---non
Yeah.---non
Language isn't the key, but sometimes you need to use it hard to get to know what they want.---non
Something like this.---non
Yeah.---non
Yeah, I'm glad to help you.---int
If you have chance you can come to visit my restaurant also.---nkn
Yeah, no worries, and it was kind of one of the best Chinese restaurants in St. Petersburg and also one of the landmarks in St. Petersburg, something like this.---non
Yeah, we are kind of three in one.---non	
We have the restaurant, we have the bar and also, we have the smoke zone, something like this.---non
The most valuable lesson that I think I have learned from my working place was that you should never underestimate the occupation that you are going with.---non
You know sometimes some people feel like: I don't want to be a waiter because waiter is a very low skilled job, I can't learn anything from such low job occupations because it makes me a low person, but the reality doesn't work this way.---non
Some Chinese people have very high vanity, they like to buy luxury goods to show their data scores, and they want to be a manager in some famous companies like JP Morgan, like Citi, but sometimes you shouldn't make your expectations so high.---non
If you have such high expectations for your future, for your occupations, for your future careers, you have a high possibility of being disappointed if you didn't reach your goals.---non
So I put my goals very low because I know my ability.---int
Previously I also behaved as most of the Chinese people.---ext
I want to go to one of the top 20 universities in the world and after graduation I will be a super manager in some top 100 companies in the world.---int
But sometimes, that isn't the future of you.---non
Sometimes you desire very low at first.---non
Do some, you can just divide your goals into some achievable goals and achieve the goals step by step.---non
Just make yourself as low as possible.---non
Sometimes don't give too many expectations to yourself.---non
You know, previously I also was seeking some manager jobs in some big company in St. Petersburg, but I failed.---non
So, I started to make myself as low as possible to do something that I can do, but it doesn't mean that I'm a low person.---int	
I did a great job.---int
I love my job.---int
It isn't that high, but I receive good salaries.---non
I receive 70,000 rubles for one month.---non
I receive tips every day, and I receive some love letters from girls.---non
I have my own surprise, you know.---non
You know, every day I come to my restaurant, I have surprises.---non
I met different people.---non
I knew new people and I get free coffee, I get a free meal, I get a free taxi back home, you know sometimes you shouldn’t image yourself so perfectly just treat yourself as low as possible do some lawless job from the very beginning.---non
This is the greatest lesson that I learned from my workplace.---int	
It depends on the country, I think.---non
To have some restaurants in Russia, it is a money-making industry, but if you want to have a restaurant in China it's goanna be a problem, because nowadays China doesn't have a very good environment.---non
A lot of the youngsters, millennials, generation Z, they are kind of having no opportunities in China because all the opportunities have been occupied by the older generations.---non	
You know, in this year, China will have 10 million graduates, but only 10% of them, they will be able to find decent job.---non	
But 90% of the Chinese graduates, they will be confronted with unemployment.---non
That's a serious problem.---non
But also, you know, China nowadays has a lot of down industries.---non	
For example, the brick and mortar and the physical stores.---non	
If I want to have a restaurant in China, I need to pay for the rent.---non	
I need to pay for the electricity, water, employees, food, everything.---non
You know, a lot of the Chinese customers, they are very picky, they are very fastidious.---non	
You know, doing something related to this restaurant in China, you will spend all of your time doing something useless, I think.---non
It won't make you money, but it definitely will make you lose a lot of money.---non
So, I won't consider having a restaurant in China, but maybe I will have some restaurants related with African food in Russia.---int
Because, you know, in Russia, you have never heard about the African food, right?---non
But the African food is very popular.---non
One of my best friends, William, cooked me a lot of Nigerian stew meat.---non
I really like this dish.---non
So, as far as I can see, in Russia, there isn’t any African restaurants.---non	
I will be very glad to have some African restaurants in Russia, maybe in Yekaterinburg, maybe in Vladivostok, yeah, for these two cities, something like this.---non
Yes, yes, yes.---non
It really depends on the situation, because I really want to continue to study my PhD degree of management in Russia because the Russian government, they were very willing to provide me the full scholarship.---non
It gives me a huge motivation because it means that I'm good student.---ext
I'ma  hard-working student and PhD because I like studying.---int	
Studying turns me into a better human being, but I think I had already chosen my destination in Russia.---int
I would be very willing to go to Yekaterinburg or Vladivostok.---int
So Vladivostok is very near to China, and also it has very beautiful Japanese seas.---non
That's a good place for me to go, but also Yekaterinburg, because I really can't make the decision right now, because I had already let my best friend, Troby, who can speak five languages, I had already let my best friend help me apply for the full scholarship of my PhD degrees.---non
If I get the full scholarship of my PhD degree in Yekaterinburg, I will go to Yekaterinburg.---non	
If I get that in Vladivostok, I will go to Vladivostok, something like this.---non
So and also while I was studying my PhD degrees I will start here to do my Tik-Tok because I'm also a blogger and also influencer in China.---non
I will continue to do my tik-tok and make my outcomes, have millions of fans, so I can do some endorsements to some brands you know, I can be a superstar.---non
I think learning Russian is the most important part because the first time that I've been to Russia was in 2019, and since then I was studying Russian as a minor language, composed really, but I didn't pay a lot of attention to Russian because I can speak English to everyone around me, so I spent most of my time on improving my English.---non
Nowadays, even right now, I am reading some English literature every day to remember some native expressions or something like this.---non
But Russian is a very important language for me to grasp because if I want to live in Russia and continue to build some bond with Russian entrepreneurs, I must learn Russian because not all the Russian people can speak English.---non
And also, you know, in China they have a very good relationship with people, with countries in the Middle Asia.---non
For example, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and also Russia, Belarus, Ukraine.---non
The Russian is the dominant language in this zone.---non
And for example, one of my main friends in my restaurant, he's from Uzbekistan.---non
He likes me very much, but he can't speak English.---non
Every time he was saying something like "Hi, how are you?". ---non	
And he was worried about whether I'm hungry or not.---non	
He treated me very well.---non
I really want to talk to him, but I can't speak Russian.---non
So that's a pity.---non
So in the future, Russian is the main thing that I need to improve.---non
Because if I want to have business in Russia and in the Middle East, Middle Asia countries, I must learn Russian.---non
Something like this.---non
Critics?---non
I think I have been scolded and criticized a lot.---non
I think if someone, especially your boss, criticized you, you should accept it.---ext
Everyone will be negative, they will somehow have some negative emotions with regard to the critics, but the critics can improve your behavior.---non	
You must know that something isn't appropriate for you to do, because the first time if you make mistakes, you got scolded, that's totally fine because you don't know anything, but I'm the person that won't make the same mistake again.---non
I can make a lot of mistakes, but different mistakes, I won't make the same mistake again.---non	
That's very important.---non
And sometimes you should be very critical-thinking, you know.---non
Getting scolded isn't your problem.---non
And you should appreciate the critics from the others because they are helping you.---ext
They are saving you.---non
You know, in China we have an old saying that if you want to destroy a person, just say glorious words to him or her for every day.---non
He will be drowned in himself or herself and he will continue to die because of his mistake.---non
He doesn’t know his mistake.---non
It is a good way for you to know your own mistakes because actually I think the mistakes make you grow up, make you a better person, something like this, so you should be appreciative of all the mistakes that you have made.---non
You know, sometimes I feel that I have made a lot of mistakes in the past, and sometimes I can’t reconcile with myself perfectly because I feel that I was totally a failure.---int
No, because at least, I was very thankful for all the mistakes, for all the experiences that I had in my life, because without this, I couldn't be myself right now, something like this.---non
Yes, yes, yes, yes.---non
I think I prefer to work in a team.---non
Sometimes I don't want to be overloaded because previously I was in a team and my teammates did nothing and I do all the home assignments by myself and they get the scores with no efforts dedicated.---non
But right now, you see, I really like to work in the team with some hard-working teammates.---int	
They are dividing the task equally and they can help you and sometimes, you know, working in a team can help you to know each other better, can help you work collaboratively with others.---non
You know, working in a team is very important because in China we say that you can't do everything alone by yourself.---ext
But you have to get used to working in team because right now I only value exchange and effective communications.---int
Value exchange is the preliminary stage of value of working in a team.---non
You need to use other people's advantages to achieve your goals, and you need to give them some benefits.---non
Something like this.---non
The value exchange is a very important tool for you to be successful because it is too weak for you to do everything alone by yourself.---non
It's better to collaborate with others who have the valuable values that you can use.---ext
Something like this.---non
From my personal perspective if we want to win together I can let you win more you know sometimes 50/50 isn't a good deal I can get 30 you get 70 percent something like this but conflict means that we have some unsatisfications between each other, so we need to solve this.---ext
Because if conflicts existed, that means both of us, have problems.---non
So, we need to point out the problems first.---non
For example, if it is my problem, I was too emotional, oh, I need to change, I need to manage my emotions.---int
But this is also your problem.---ext
You were debating with me for all the time.---ext
This is your problem.---ext
You also need to change.---ext
You know, we need, both of us, we need to change.---non	
No, if the if the conflicts existed, which means both of us, they need to make some change and improve the models that we were getting along with each other, something like this.---non
Work-life balance.---non
Sometimes the balance doesn't exist at all, because right now I am working full-time.---non
Every time when I get back home, I don't even have the time to wash my clothes, to eat.---non
I just want to sleep.---non
Sometimes, for me, I need to sacrifice life first and dedicate everything to the work, because it isn't that easy to get money.---non
If you want to get the work-life balance, you need to be financially independent first.---non
But if you are not financially independent first, then you need to sacrifice one.---non
Everyone is sacrificing life right now to get more money from the work.---non
Not only me, but everybody does the same.---ext
I can't say that I'm good in time management, but at least I'm a responsible guy.---int
As long as it's a task dedicated from my boss or for my teachers I will do it.---ext
Before the deadlines.---non
You know, I'm not a person that makes plans.---int
I do everything very casually.---non
So, I kind of catch up the deadlines, you know, at the last day or something like this.---non
I'm a guy like this.---non
But it depends on the person.---non
I really want to say that because I don't like to make plans, because I know that every day, there will be a lot of unexpected things to happen.---int
Making plans, I don't think it's very important for me.---int
If I made plans, I would have to change my plans for everything.---int
I hope I really do help you with your projects.---int
You too.---non
Mr. Michael, welcome.---non
It's my pleasure.---int
Okay, thank you for your question.---non
I'm an operations manager for a right heading business.---non
And the drivers come in to pick them up.---non
I have 15 people working under me.---non
So basically with the operation team, we make sure that the app is functioning well.---non
Drivers are being paid with their balances on the app.---non
We are giving them the right campaigns that will motivate them to do their business.---non
And we are also solving issues when it comes to bad driver behavior.---non
Yeah.---non
And bad rider behavior too.---nkon
So basically I think that's the entirety of my job responsibilities.---non	
And it's my duty to make sure that, uh, people working under me.---non
Uh, most of the times the job is more about dedication, just making sure you are appointing or you're selecting the right subordinate for the right job and empowering them to also become their own bosses in the future.---ext
Thank you.---non
I really love my working environment.---int
It's an information service company.---non	
So I think for me, one particular thing that I admire so much is the fact that I can just pick my t-shirt, pick my trailer, and wear my sneaker and go to work.---int
So the company has a term called we don't, we don't entertain corporate bullshit.---non
Like I don't have to be in a suit and tie before I can perform, perform, uh, exceptionally well at my workplace.---non	
Uh, we, we are just a team of young people, so you always come to see enthusiasm.---non
There, there is always that exchange of ideas.---non
People share their ideas and there are lots of bright minds, minds around.---non
So always you are, you are that excited to come to work, to listen to what someone would want to say, or some idea that will come up from even the, the lowest of person in the rank that you don't, you don't expect at the workplace.---ext
So basically that is how my job environment environments is.---non
You are welcome.---non	
Thank, thank you for the question.---non	
So in as much as as a business, we always would want to meet our KPIs, meet our business goals, get more revenues, uh, generate more net profits, like get more net profits.---ext
Thank you.---non
Thank you very much for the question.---non
So for me, the most recent achievement is the expansion, the business expansion that we did recently in 2024.---int
So we realized as a business we were just, uh, dominant in a crime.---ext	
And we had to spread, spread our wings, commercial integrity, and we had to spread our wings to other citizens.---non
And you see the most, most of the times in cities, countries like Ghana or in Africa, people there are always in the capital.---non
So people coming from other cities will always be in the capital.---non
And when they are coming from your cities and they have an idea or they have some knowledge about your business already, when they come, it becomes easy for them to use your services.---non
I know definitely that based on our calculations and our projections, we realize that we are not really going to operate in certain areas.---ext	
They're not going to really yield more profits like that.---non
But it had more benefits for our performance in Accra.---non
And definitely it's like it happened and it boomed.---non
We, we launched our operations in the northern parts of Ghana.---non
We did for Origin, we did for Cape Coast.---non
Because the internet penetration in Ghana is not that huge.---non
And basically we would want people to know about us.---non
We have to go to places where people will be comfortable with us.---ext	
Then when they come in that capacity, it'll become very easy for them to use our services.---non
So for me, I think that is a very good achievement as a business to not to only look at the profitability side, but to look at the overall impact it will have on the entire business as a whole.---int
You're welcome.---non
Okay, thank you for your question.---non	
So for me, decision making as a manager is one of the most challenging activities or challenging responsibilities on your decks because if you don't create room for people to come up with ideas or if you don't create room for dialogue to be made or collaboration be made, it always makes you fixated to something that is a cake, something that is rigid, something that makes it very, very difficult for your people or team members to adjust or play their part in implementing the decision after it's been made because, uh, there is a saying that, idea is not in one month's head rise.---ext
And the youth, there's also another saying that the, the young ones are the one full of ideas.---ext
So if you open that room for people to make, definitely in the business sector, the final decision has to come, come from the manager, right?---ext
Or the final decision has to come from the board.---ext
But if you give room for people to also come up with ideas and that decision is being made and you credit the people that came up with ideas, it helps to foster that coordination, that collaboration in the business.---ext
And it helps people to appreciate what their input that they are bringing to the table.---ext
And they tend to to stay longer and give more and better results for the company.---non
So for me, out all my decisions that I make in the company, I always make sure that I have my team involved.---ext	
It's not a one month thing, it's a collaborating thing.---ext
Then we do it and we do it together to achieve the resource that we want.---ext
We have quite a number of partnerships because sometimes we provide PS on our platform to motivate hardworking drivers.---non
And also sometimes we provide ps for let me say truthful passengers.---non
For example there's a passenger that, no, for truthful drivers, there's a driver that someone left huge sums of money in his car and he returned it.---non	
But if it had been somebody who tried to be corny and run away with the money, it would take some time for us to get him.---non
And we also provide insurance.---non
We work with insurance companies to provide some insurance packages for the drivers.---non
We also work with a network company.---non
I think before July, 2024, we signed the biggest network company in Ghana, um, to provide some data services for our drivers, which they started implementing in September, which is actually a good thing.---non
So you can, no one is an airline.---non
You can't do everything on your own, no matter what.---ext	
We also have partnership with some four stations.---non
We provide four vouchers.---non
Uh, we have a partnership with one, uh, maintenance comment, car maintenance shop in AC garage, which helps our top performing drivers to service their cars and maintain their tires and those things.---non	
We definitely would need services from people and it is always good for businesses to bond and do business together.---non
Okay.---non
Thank you for your question.---non	
So when it comes to information dissemination, I think with my company, I think in the beginning of our conversation, I made mention of the fact that we don't entertain corporate bullshit.---int
Not to say that we don't have a procedure or a proper way of communication in our company.---non
We do have a proper way of com communication in our company.---not	
We use an internal communication platform called "We".---non
We do have access to corporate emails and other stuff, but it's an internal communication to call Slack.---non	
Where each one has particular channels, particular groups, there are channels for general manager.---non
There are channels for managers, there are channels for the executive board.---non
There are channels for project managers, operation managers, uh, customer support managers, like all these channels are there where we communicate, we tag people that are responsible for particular jobs and other stuff.---non
But I have people that supervise me.---non
If I want to communicate anything to my bosses, there's nothing that can't stop me from channeling my ideas or asking them question about anything that there is that openness in our, in my company.---non
Because you are not allowed to restrict someone from making their point because no one knows the reason, the reason why as a company, we stand with this with distance is because one of our verticals that we are operating, I think the business operates in 150 countries, started by someone who was lower in the rank.---non
It was his idea that brought up that vertical and it was being worked on and became bigger and bigger, started generating more revenue than even the oldest vertical.---non
Like it started generating almost half of the revenue in the oldest vertical the business was generating.---non
So our communication is open.---non	
You talk to your, you talk to, there is that proper feedback system we have.---non	
We do reviews of performances, we do reviews of attacks, all those things.---non
And people, whenever there are issues or there are conflicts, we find the best way to resolve this conflict.---non
And as so far as we are, we are humans.---non
There will be one or two issues of people having one or two misunderstandings with a colleague or with a workmate.---non	
And we find out the best way to resolve this and not to make these people have hidden hate within, within the team to affect the overall team performance.---non	
I get what you're saying.---non
Yeah, yeah, sure.---non
I think I've worked a number of jobs as a person, I started after uni, I started as a teacher.---non
I did some freelance job, uh, personally as an IT support, like I was moving around supporting people, people who needed my services.---non
Then I worked with the mining servicing company for six months before I moved into the tech industry proper.---non
So I would say from the mining services company, after that I've been with my company for six years.---non
So the mining services company, the only difference I see is with the mining services company, they are using a traditional approach.---non
If your boss says this, you cannot say the otherwise.---ext
You understand.---non
If your boss says, you cannot even chip in your idea what you think, because the whole perception is you are just fresh from school, you don't really have any sort of experience.---ext
You're not supposed to be the one to question my idea or you're not supposed to be the one, don't object.---non	
What I come up with, just follow the rules and do your work.---int
Right.---non
In the bias servicing company, you are supposed to dress in a particular way, always you look like, uh, I don't know how to put it, but with my current job, I can just put my t-shirts, I can even put on, um, cam shoes and come to work.---non
I when I come to work, I can take my sneaker off and put on my Crocs and just do my work.---non
Mine is just to do my work, not necessarily how I look or how, and one of the thing I love about my current job is the fact that I work three days in the office, two days in the house.---int
So that's for me that those things are the major differences why I've come to love working here.---int	
And I would probably would love to keep spending some time here and help them do very well as a business and expand across more cities in Ghana.---int	
So I have a funny story about my probation.---non	
Okay.---non
And I think I would say this as an advice for anyone that will ever go into any business and will be put on probation.---int
For me, I think the key thing that managers want to see during probation is someone that is willing to learn.---int	
Because no matter where I came from, you might have the experience already, but sectors and fuels and companies are different in terms of procedures and protocols and operations.---non	
Okay?---non
Right.---non
So regardless of the principle, the experience you came with, just have that adaptability spirit to adapt to the system that you were in.---ext
When I joined my company, I joined with one guy.---non
He was, you know, in Ghana, uh, people consider that people from asasi to be brighter than any because of the structure of learning and the kind of lecturers they have in their school.---non
So I joined with one guy from Asasi.---non	
He was, I think he was, let me say he was ranked higher than me because of the university he was coming from.---non
But that guy didn't have the desire and the energy, the hunger and the test that I had or the passion I had for the work.---int
Because although I came from the IT field, I was new to data analytics, if you understand.---non	
And how quick I was able to adapt, adapt and adapt to the business goals and the business metrics and those things.---ext	
And how I was able to understand the connectivity of these metrics and the things that I'm supposed to do to, if A is misbehaving, things I'm supposed to do with B to make sure it's part A, if C'S misbehaving what I'm supposed to do to part A.---non	
And those things, at that time the business was going through some kind of rough patch, but I believe it was those things that made them realize that no, regardless of the the struggles that we are going through, this guy is more hungry for success and we have to give him the chance to stay and also help him to become better.---ext
So for me, probation, the most important thing is let the organization see that willingness to learn and that spirit of adaptability and let them see that, that design, passion, passion you spoke about during your interview.---ext
Yeah, sure.---non
Mentorship, but even as I'm sitting here, I like, I still need ten more mentors.---non
Mentorship, mentorship is very, very important because in as much as we as people, we always say that make your own mistakes and learn from them.---ext
It's always best to know someone's mistake and learn from learn from that mistake.---ext
It makes it shorter and simpler because we don't have time, we think we have time in this life, we don't have that much time.---non
By the time you will be done making your mistakes and learning from them, time would've been far spent, far gone.---non
And you will not be able to achieve what you would want to achieve.---non
So mentorship is important for me, I'll keep on looking for more mentors, people that can help me, guide me, and who will motivate me to become a better version of myself.---ext
And I would love to mentor people.---ext	
My doors are always open for other people, black people to come, so that I can also share what I've learned and the knowledge I've gained.---ext	
So far, but, I still have some people I mentor when it comes to work and when it comes to, let me say, public Christian life.---non
So that is it when it comes to mentorship.---non	
Okay, thank you for your question.---non	
So when it comes to motivation, I would say that family is my motivation in everything that I do because when I wake up in the morning, I look at my wife's face, uh, it motivates me.---ext	.
I look at my kids' face, it motivates me because basically I need to feed them.---ext
I need to take care of the home.---ext
I need to take care of my extended family: my dad, my mom, my sisters.---ext
Uh, I didn't come alone in this life.---ext
So always there are people, people I look up to, to draw energy from, to draw enthusiasm from.---ext
But for me, I think I always would want to, I always say that sometimes with motivation it diminishes.---non
So I always try my best to keep that spirit of discipline because discipline is more of like, uh, it's like if you're able to develop that discipline, it's like cocaine.---non	
You can't stop.---non
Like it's always, it is always flaming in you, when you want to get, you have to do.---int
And when it comes to challenges at work, when I joined my visit, my company had understand, I think I had, at that point in time, I had not learned how to, how to withstand challenges.---int
And whenever we are in turbulence, I start to panic and I start to, I start to pass on the negative energy onto subordinate advice.---ext
So at the point I started learning from that, and at the moment I think I can, I can probably say that, uh, I've learned how to become calm.---int
I've learned how to understand that everything that happens will pass.---int
Like it's just for a particular moment.---non
Like those things are faces, like it will pass.---non
'cause during covid time we went down, like, much like our projection went down.---non	
Like there was lockdown, businesses were closing down, like things worked out and nothing was happening.---non
And we were, I was scared.---int
Like I wasn't really, really scared for myself because I felt that if even if the company sinks, with the lot of experience that I have, I might get a different job if things become normal.---int
But I was scared for the new guys that had entered like the fresh people, that had put their trust in me for me to help them grow and for me to help them push them to the higher heights.---est
And all of a sudden, my idea came in mind and we created a protected category in Ghana for the first time, and people like bounced to the idea and our members started jumping and growing and growing and growing.---non
So those moments taught me very important message in life that sometimes you just have to be calm.---int	
If you're a Christian you just have to pray because God actually is the give off ideas and knowledge.---non
So for me, challenges shouldn't be something to make you fold and make you make you slow down.---int
It's a pleasure to talking to you, Mr.---non
I'm good.---int
You?---non
So actually, thank you for having me.---non
Yeah, sure.---non
So, you know, my name is M.B. Shtiak and I am from Australia, Sydney, Australia.---non
And I lived in Bangladesh last five years.---non
I used to work in human resources.	---non
I worked with multinational companies and international development organizations before.---non	
And in Australia, I'm actually pursuing my masters right now.---non
I doing a master of business management at Central Queensland University.---non	
And also, I'm working in a retail shop as a retail associate.---non
Okay okay.---non	
Uh before that.---non
Yeah.---non	
So in Australia my work is a retail associate which i've just told you and before that.---non
Yes, I have worked near about five years in human resources and my last job was with a multinational company and that was genpa Bangladesh, it's a subsidiary of Julpa UAE that's one of UAE's largest producer and exporter of medicines and before that I worked with Friendship International, an international development organization.---non	
I worked there for about three years so altogether my work experience in human resources is five years, a little bit more than five years.---non
And yeah.---non	
Yeah, so I've actually worked in two different work setups because before I moved to Australia, I've never worked in retail.---non	
Retail is totally different than what I used to do in Bangladesh because that was like nine to five corporate job.---non
That was like a desk job but in Australia it's like a retail job.---non	
So uh that was quite new for me because i've never worked in retail before and if you ask me about work culture difference i wouldn't be able to describe an official setup in Australia because I didn't work in an office setup in Australia yet so I'm yet to experience that.---int
But in retail, it's very fast paced.---non
And the thing is you have to work in a team, of course.---non
And that's quite similar to how we used to work in Bangladesh as well.---non
I mean, you have to work in teams and also work culture is like in Bangladesh, people are more emotional and here people are more practical.---non
So also there's another significant difference that I have noticed so far is in Bangladesh, some local organizations, fortunately, I didn't have to work with a lot of local organizations, I worked with like multinationals and INGOs.---int
But I have had friends who have worked with like local organizations.---non	
And there it was, it was something like when you ask for a leave and your employer, they don't seem to be very happy about it, even though you are entitled to take leaves, like sick leaves, casual leaves, whatever.---non
So this is a significant change here in Australia.---non	
So, yeah, these are a few significant changes that I have noticed so far.---int
Okay.---non
So i'll give you a very practical answer to that because a lot of fabricated answers would sound like so I love to help people and all for me.---int
Actually because I have been working human resources before I love to work with people, I love helping people and even though I have never worked in retail, this kind of job, working in retail, it requires you to be a very good communicator.---int
And also you have to be able to help people.---ext	
Because in retail, what happens, when someone comes to your store, they're actually looking for something.---non	
So you are there to help them make that purchase decision or make suggestions based on their needs.---int
That's what I enjoy about my job.---int
That would be a very generalized answer but in addition to that since i was new to a retail sector and for the first week I didn't even think that I could survive the retail environment, because I moved to Australia from a different country, and some people from eastern suburbs have a distinct accent which I was having like a really hard time trying to understand.---int
But eventually after a week, I actually started to get their accent, started to understand what they're trying to say.---non
And I started to communicate well.---non	
What excites me most about my job is if the store makes the budget, I mean like daily budget and then we have a weekly budget and then a monthly budget, if the store makes budget you get bonus so for me it's like entirely money.---ext
Money motivates me because I'm an international student here and I have a lot of bills to pay, I have to save for my university as well, so expenses as well tuition fees etc etc.---ext
I have to pay like every kind of bills that I have, so for me if I do well in my job that means I'll get some bonus at the end of the month.---ext
So doing well in my job is not an option for me, that's what I strive to do because I know a lot of people will give you a different answer, but for me money is the biggest motivator.---ext
So it motivates me, that's what actually excites me about my job.---ext
Valuable lessons?---non
Yeah.---non
Okay.---non
So that should be never to take anything to heart because I have had very difficult customer who would make some racist comments.---int
Also, I've had really good customers at the same time most of my customers are really good.---non	
The one valuable lesson that I learned from my job is to let go of whatever is bothering you, you have to let it go.---int
If you let it ruin your day what will happen that you will lack in performance.---ext
And if you lack in performance, you will not be able to make the budget.---non	
So you will still get your salary, of course, but you will not get the bonus that you need to pay a lot of your bills, so for me it's not an option.---int	
For me the valuable lesson is to let go and never take like anything too hard.---int
Yeah that's what I learned.---non
So we are a team of four people in our shop right now.---non	
But the thing is even though we are a team, most of the time we work alone because of the store hour.---non
We have limited store hours so most of the time we are working by ourselves.---non
But sometimes there are crossovers and for two-three hours we get to work together with another team member, that's at max two people at the same time.---non
You compliment each other and you cooperate with each other and especially during rush hour like Christmas season.---non
So if your team performs well and if you are cooperating and communicating well with your team, it gets a lot easier.---non	
So I'm actually very flexible in terms of working with a team or working by myself.---non
Most of the times I work by myself.---non
All right, so I wouldn't say that conflict never happens in my work.---int	
So I have had a fair share of conflicts before and in my current job as well.---non
For example I wouldn't say it was a very difficult kind of conflict but sometimes I go extra mile so that my store performs well.---ext
So sometimes when we close at night at around like 9, 10, as it is like high season now, so whenever some other team member closes, they do not always leave the store very tidy.---non	
They have to do cleanings.---non	
They have to do all sort of works.---non	
So it's really difficult.---non
If the last person closing the last night doesn't eave the store tidy, clean and organized, it's very difficult for the next person who comes in to open.---non
Okay.---non
I had some sort of disagreement with one of my colleagues.---non
Work-life balance is simple: you have to have a healthy lifestyle and also you got to work because without work how are you going to pay your bills.---non	
Right.---non
I know my next week's plan because the roaster has been published prior to a week.---non	
At least we know what am I going to do forthe next one week and when am I working and when am I not, and when do I have classes, and when do I have exams.---int
So I try to manage my time based on that and on weekends I, sometimes like to go to the beach, take a dive into the ocean or hang out with my friends, go to movies, or i love to read a lot of books.---non	
I carry books with me like everywhere.---non
So that's what I do.---non
And also sometimes I talk to my parents back at home and my friends.---non	
And my friends overseas, I talk to them sometimes.---non	
I try to stay connected to everyone.---non
That's how I sort of try to  balance my work and life so that I have a social life, I have personal time for myself, and also I have enough time to study and work.---non	
Okay.---non	
So I can actually give you an answer in two different ways.---non	
From my prior experience experience in human resources, that's what I can do, give you an answer from that perspective and my present perspective.---non
I'll try to blend and give you one simple answer, okay?---non
So for someone who's wanting to start their career my suggestion is be bold and also don't be scared of anything.---non
When i started working in retail I had zero experience in retail.---non	
Actually I always have been very good with interviews because I took a lot of interviews in my life.---non
So I know what sort of questions are being asked in interview.---non
So I was always good at interview and I did well in my interview.---int	
But when I got the job for retail associate and in my first day at work, I had such cold feet.---int
And I was not understanding anyone's accent, like the people of the shire have a different kind of accent, they use a lot of acronyms that I'm not familiar with).---non
When I started working in retail I started to doubt.---int	
Thank you so much, Mr. Ghosh, for having me in your session i hope it helps.---non
If you need any further assistance or support regarding whatever queries you might have feel free to write to me.---ext
thank you so much for having me.---non	
Thank you.---non
Have a nice rest of the day.---non
Bye.---non
Okay.---non
Great.---non
Hi, everyone.---non
Uh, my name is Farhad.---non
Uh, my last name is Yuldashev.---non
I am deputy Station manager of Uzbekistan Airways in the Russian Federation, based in Moscow.---non
Do I have to describe my position, what I have to do here?---non
Okay, great.---non
Uh, my position is, actually we are responsible for all the regular flights and charter flights, which operate to the Russian Federation.---non	
And actually we're responsible just for operating flights.---non	
The technical, all the technical issues, any questions from passengers.---non
We’re responsible for it.---non	
Actually I like aviation.---int
So, to work overseas, it's the best experience for, I think, for everyone.---int	
So in this case, for me, also, but, the difficulties is, this is foreign country.---int	
This is not my native country, so that's why it's a little bit difficult to live in another country, not in native country.---int
And for my family also.---non
This is a difficulty.---non
The, the biggest difficulty is this.---non
Uh, sorry?---non
Uh, a little bit, yeah.---non
A little.---non	
Actually, it's not pointed just in Russia, it's pointed overseas.---non
Uzbekistan is native country.---non
I'm like a fish in the sea in Uzbekistan.---int
So that's why it's better to be in Uzbekistan.---non
But for experience, it's a good opportunity to work overseas.---non	
Uh, the main motivation is to improve my skills, to improve my working skills, to get more experience.---int	
This motivates me.---ext	
Probably, in Tashkent it was an office job.---non
It means I just sit in one cabinet and there is no connection with customers, with people.---non
But in here, when you are responsible for the all the flights, you have the opportunity to speak with passengers, with the staff of the airport, with the crew members of the airplane.---non
Also technical issues of the airplanes.---non
You will see.---non
This is a good experience for, I think, for every person who works with aviation.---int	
Ideal colleague?---non	
Interesting question.---non
The first one - communication.---non
If we, for example, look the same way, this is good for the person who works with the other person.---non
Let me explain.---ext
For example, if I think like my colleague, it's better and easier to work with him or her.---non	
Also the language level.---non	
In the Russian Federation as you...---non
Let me explain first: in Uzbekistan, the first language, native language, is the Uzbek language, the second is Russian.---non
So it's easy to communicate here.---non	
And all the staff in our representation speak in Russian.---non
It's easy to communicate.---non
And also how to explain... former Soviet Union people, we think similar to how people in the Russian Federation think.---non	
So this is also easy for...---non
I heard from my colleagues in Europe, in the United States, they think differently from Russia actually, former Soviet Union people.---ext
So this is good for work here.---non	
This is easy.---non	
Yes-yes...---non	
I didn't get the idea.---non
The biggest problem is the customers.---non
As you know, if you work, it depends on the customer.---ext	
All the customers are different.---non	
Sometimes, in our case, not customers, probably passengers.---non
Yeah.---non
Some passengers understand, some passengers don't understand.---non
Some passengers start to explain the rule, which we already know.---non	
This is big trouble, how to explain our position.---non	
Interesting question.---non
Probably we don't have any problems because my colleagues, everything and everybody is well-experienced, and we understand each other, so there is no problem.---non
If we have some trouble with my colleagues, if I have some trouble, I just explain it.---non
If they don't want to understand, I will tell about this to my top manager.---non
And he will explain.---non
How to organize?---non	
By letter or by words?---non
What do you mean?p---non	
Communication style?---non
Just knock on the door, open the door, sit and tell everything.---non
Yes-yes.---non
Actually, I have two positions in this representation.---non	
The first one, I am the deputy representative of the region - regional representation.---non
It means that I'm responsible for more than 10 stations in the Russian Federation.---non
This is Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Omsk, Perm et cetera.---non
And my second position is I am responsible for the shift at the airport Vnukovo.---non	
It depends.---non
Let me explain how I start my day.---non	
The first day I am responsible in Vnukovo airport, daytime.---non	
And the second day, the next day, I'm responsible for the nighttime in airport Vnukovo.---non
The third day I have a day off because I'm not sleeping all night.---non
So, the fourth day I'm responsible in regional representation and come back again.---non	
I come to the airport.---non
I check all the information about the flights, which will be in my shift.---non
And then start the registration of passengers.---non
During the registration, a lot of questions come from passengers.---non	
We try to solve this.---non	
If they don't understand,  I explained before, I just, we just tell to complain or send the question to our head office.---non	
That's it.---non
And close the registration and depart the flight.---non	
That's it.---non
Yes.---non
Same.---non		
But in the office.---non	
In  the regional representation, it's a little bit different because this is office work.---non
We communicate with our stations in the Russian Federation, by email, by the phone, like this.---non
It's online actually.---non	
Yes.---non	
In aviation, actually, my professional skills improved, improved a lot.---non
in Uzbekistan, in the head office, my position was in a protocol and visa department specialist.---non	
All of other things, it's different.---non	
So I improved my skills in everything to operate the flight.---ext
But before I didn't get that.---non	
So when I started to work here, it was news for me.---non	
And it was a little bit difficult the first time.---non	
Thanks to all my colleagues, to everybody.---ext	
They helped me.---non
They explained what I have to do, what I have to not do.---non	
Now  I'm not professional, but I think I'm much improved from before.---int		
In professional career?---non	
In the Russian Federation?---non	
To communicate with people.---non	
This is a very difficult, very difficult thing, to communicate with people.---non
And now it's different because people start to get angry so fast.---non
So that's why.---non
Before?---non
Yes, because, now I think, in my opinion, people start to think too much about making money.---int	
So that's why they start to be angry.---int
Before you said something and it was normal for them, but now they start to get angry so fast.---non
My own business?---non
I never think about that because maybe I'm not a businessman, that's why.---int
But if I start my own business, what I?...---non	
In which position?---non
You mean?---non	
Uh, in which way to start or what?---non	
Aviation, maybe.---non
Maybe catering.---non
It's good also to make money.---non
It's interesting to provide the food to flights.---non	
Because, you know, the business which comes with food, from this business you can make more money than another, because you spend, for example, $1 and you will get back more.---non
Maybe, that's why.---non
…Where… is the catering business?---non
The best.---non
You mean, in which city?---non
In which country?---non	
Yeah?---non
Where?---non
I think it's Turkey.---int	
Because of a lot of flights there.---non
Where there are a lot of flights, you have a lot of customers.---non
A lot of customers.---non
A lot of money.---non
No problem.---non
I love it.---int	
Because I speak English, I remember my English, I start to speak better, but I feel that I forget a lot of words.---int
It's a little bit different.---non
To speak.---non
OK, so my name is Jack, my surname is Jackman.---non
Well, I am from South Korea and I'm 27 years old.---non	
I studied here in Russia and finished the Saint Peterburg State University of Faculty of Management.---non
Now currently I'm working in Russian company named HTS which is producing coolers and chillers and working in international department of exporting the stuff.---non	
Well, basically our company has individual plans for each person and we as international staff need to achieve these goals.---non
For example, in the first quarter, I need to make at least 100 cold calls or 20 hot calls.---non
And when I'm finished, this means that I've done my job well.---ext
And I just follow the rules of our head managers.---ext	
I guess it depends on the situation, depends on question.---non	
However, everything in our company related to results.---ext
For example, if you made a decision and this leads to resolution, you will have a bonus.---non	
However, if the consequences of this decision are  bad, still the management will tell you that	next time you should think better because it leads to mistakes and even losses for the company.---non
Well, I definitely believe nowadays in my place now where I work, I have the ideal environment of working because in our office, in our department we have 6 managers who are currently working in exporting stuff in the Central Asia region and our work is balanced in terms of how they are all professionals who respect each other.---non
However, we are ready to help each other.---non	
For example, if I have questions, I can ask any of my partners and they will help me and if they have questions I also will help them.---non
So this is an ideal environment where everybody is professional, however they always try to help each other.---non	
Well my work starts at 9:00 AM usually by checking my e-mail because I need to communicate with my partners from other countries and emails is the best way of communication.---non
So after checking emails if I have some offers or questions I usually phone call them which is called hot calls until like 13 PM and then I have a break.---non	
After the break I just have two hours of co-work with my partners of my department when we discuss our issues, problems or any advantages we made during the day.---non
So after this I just start making cold calls or sending emails with the product, trying to also answer the questions not just employees but also customers.---non	
The end of the work day, I just leave some my comments to my partners.---non
I guess last month it wasn't my individual achievement, it was our department achievement where we reached the agreement with with some Uzbek company name trust.---non
We created a project where we'll implement our product in their huge project.---non	
And this project already has been approved by our managers and by their managers and now we're working on details.---non	
I think this is one of the best deals I have had in our company.---int
Our I team had.---non	
Well, before this place I've worked in Korean company, but it was also located in Russia.---non	
The company was producing details for cars and I was also managing the company.---non
However, the atmosphere of work wasn't that good because our head department pushed us to hit unrealistic targets.---non
But here in my current job at our head office the department head knows what is better and what is achievable.---non
That is why I feel more better because now I at least know my goal is achievable.---int
And of course, atmosphere is better.---non
As I said earlier, my colleagues are very polite, very friendly and they're ready to help.---non
So this is I think the biggest difference.---int
Describe my company.---non
I'm working in HTS company.---non	
It is a Russian company.---non	
However it's now it is from 2023.---non	
I mean it's exploring some international business trying to export its products and I'm currently working in the department of International business.---non
So our company produces chillers, conditioners, coolers and etcetera.---non
It works in many fields like healthcare, railways, some oil companies etcetera.---non
So whenever you need to call in order to produce cool atmosphere, our company is ready to help.---non
Thank you for having me.---non	
Okay my name is Asma and I am an international student in HSE.---non
I'm doing my master's here in Arts and Culture Management.---non
I'm from Pakistan and apart from my studies I work here in a Russian company which provides services in Fintech so it's been more than one year that I have worked in this company.---non
For me I was new here in St. Petersburg I didn't know anything about the Russian corporate culture and I applied to many jobs and luckily, I got this job in this company which is called "Call solution" and to my surprise the environment and the support from the company and also from the government in terms of corporate laws or health issues laws regarding the jobs.---non
So the all of these things motivated me to keep going with this job and also with the job the work life balances also really good.---ext
So that was the only reason that I did not think to change my job from this job to another job and that's why I have been doing it.---ext
Yeah because it is stable and the environment was really really good in comparison to Pakistan.---non
So, the teams, everybody was supportive at work.---non	
So I really like that and I also like the laws regarding the labor which are Russian laws.---int	
So for me that was the motivation to keep going at this job.---ext
With my job yes I was working as a support agent initially for seven or eight months and I was the lucky one and maybe it was my success that in a short period of time I moved from one department to another department.---non	
Now I work in KYC which is which is more interesting than support personally for me.---int
So this is the success I believe that I have achieved and everybody in the office really praised me that I am the first to get the promotion very early in the job.---non
And I was warmly welcomed by the KYC department as well.---non	
So that was my mini success in this office.---non	
In my situation right now as a student as well this job is a perfect match so I am able to balance my studies and job along.---non	
Yes, I have more I would say desires to grow better on this position because as a human you always want to grow.---int	
I would not say this is the ideal situation where I have to be here all the time.---int
No, I really want to grow.---int	
The current situation is perfect for me.---int	
Yes, in my company there are many people who are not native Russians.---non	
They are from different parts of the world.---non
Some are from Indonesia, some are from India, some are from Spain.---non	
So there are many nationalities within the company and the majority of people in the company speak Russian, but when they are talking to us they start speaking English.---non
This environment is more welcoming, more comforting.---non
They do not completely neglect you, even in meetings they really try to speak English.---non
I really like this supportive environment and since every corporate company has events, they also celebrate events.---non
They don't keep their employees as excluded but they get along them.---non
So, I'm speaking too much but yes, it’s a really supportive environment.---non
I believe that the support that the Russian people and the Russian culture corporate environment has given us is admirable really.---int
With other company?---non	
I mean it's been quite more than a year for me they are like my another family.---non
I talked to them.---non
She always comes close and welcomes me, and there Shusha - she hugs me every time.---non
Whenever we cross each other they warmly welcome me, they talk to me friendly.---non
When it comes to tasks which we perform on daily basis these tasks are assigned in a way that everybody does the job perfectly and also their report is in English.---non
I don't know if it answered the question you have asked, but recently I asked my company to arrange an internship in the management department for my degree course.---non
They were so kind and they were so supportive, they made this collaboration with the university and designed an internship for me for in the event management department.---non
That's where I think I should appreciate them, that they agree to collaborate with the university and with the company, so there's an opportunity for a good collaboration within the company.---int
Since yes, this job is comfortable, easy and interesting as well but there is also I would say a negative point that in this job I am doing same task again, and again.---int
No, I don't hate my job to be honest, I appreciate the environment: is so friendly, so good, so comforting, so calm, and so supportive.---int
So I have never hated my job, I enjoyed it.---non
Yes, some shifts are so early that at some times I'm tired or I'm sleepy.---non
Apart from that I don't hate my job, I'm comfortable at this job.---non
That's a huge difference in what you feel now.---non
I like my country.---int
I was working as a support agent and I was under so much pressure.---non
We worked nine hours straight without a single break.---non
They used to give us like half an hour break for just eating.---non
I just don't want to use that word...---int
They just want employees to work all day without breaks.---non	
In Pakistan where I worked before it was not a good environment, the payment was not good and the behavior was not also good from the management side, they can insult you anytime.---non
In Pakistan they always wanted boys to be the higher position because all the managers were boys, all the trainers were boys and men.---non
Pakistan is already a male dominant country.---non
That company is not a small company in Pakistan, it's such a big company, it’s in a major city, in the middle of the city Iberks and it's in Karachi, so it's a huge company, but the environment was the worst and I was totally shocked when I saw the environment here in St. Petersburg, so that's a huge difference.---non
In my company it depends on what position you are so in.---non
In my position I do not have such powers to make any decision.---non
I have powers to make small decision for the customers.---non
I believe language barrier, although they do speak English.---non
They converse many times with us in English, but when you are in a certain environment where rest of people are speaking Russian and you don't understand, you feel isolated.---non
Also I believe at certain point that they might not give any foreigner the highest position.---int
They will not give the top management level position to the foreigners.---non
This is the difference, although I have not applied.---non
I'm interested.---int
I've seen that they face a struggle and they have to be very careful about everything they do.---non
Whatever is happening at the back you don't understand anything until you go and ask, so this is the challenge.---non
I believe at a certain point they might not give any.---int
It is not rule, it is just if they apply, they might consider it.---non
It is my opinion, that there is something you learn from the environment.---int
Those things are not on the pages and not in the rules, but you just learn from one to one conversation.---non	
I am proud that I got this opportunity very early since I came back here and performed very well on a customer agent job and then I shifted to another department and learned everything within two weeks.---int	
I was able to perform on the same level with other employees who were working for two to three years.---non
And I came to that position within two weeks so, it was achievement for me.---int	
I was really proud on myself.---int
My numbers, my performance number, my QA scores - everything improved and I became comfortable.---ext
I am also proud that I mingled with the whole team quickly.---int
I didn't have a problem.---non
My country needs to improve a lot in the corporate culture.---non
They have to work on the way they run the companies.---non
I don't have any questions but thank you so much for having me and good luck, thank you.---non	
Hello.---non
Can you hear me?---non	
Yeah, I'm working.---non	
I actually started to work several weeks ago.---non	
I suppose the main thing is new experience.---non
I'm just very excited about new things and work.---int	
New tasks, new projects, I have an opportunity to solve some new challenges I faced.---non	
And of course, I was very excited to meet new people at this place of work.---int
I suppose that the main key thing is transparency of work process.---non
I'm not sure how it's called, but I will explain it to you.---non
I just can sit and observe my part in the whole project, like my part of responsibilities.---non
I had to achieve the whole success, the whole task and that makes me feel good.---ext
I'm not sure what do you mean by this question about my role.---non
Do you mean my role at the workplace?---non	
Yeah, I mostly like data analytics.---int	
I just had to analyze a lot of separate pieces of information and combine them in some reports, in Excel tables and present them to my colleagues.---non	
Frankly speaking, the most appealing thing is that it's not me who takes responsibility for the main decisions of the main direction of the company.---non
I mean, when we are doing the project, we have in our command quite a strict hierarchy.---non
And I suppose I'm just in the lowest part of this, because I'm a newcomer.---non
That's why I only prepare some materials, observe some databases and still it's not me who's making really key decisions which can be really important and stressful.---non
So I'm kind of a chill guy.---non
I suppose it will help me improve my analytical skills.---int
I mean, during my master's degree I've got some theoretical knowledge about this, but I've never applied it to a real case.---non
And now I have an opportunity, so I'm quite happy with it.---int
I suppose it's really difficult for the company to achieve successful company culture, because it's kind of a balance between some empathy relation between colleagues and discipline.---int
So, understanding that you are at work and you are doing some functions.---non	
Actually, I'm not sure how I should answer this question.---int
You have to ask other people rather than me.---non
Nothing about me surprises me.---int
Actually I can name a schedule of working.---non	
I suppose it's my first time when I work in a strict schedule company, we really work from 9 a.m. till 6 p.m.---non
And I get really tired after work when I come home, it's quite exhausting to work all day in one building, in one office.---non
I'm not really used to this still.---int	
Yeah, that company is related to international relations and my bachelor’s degree is in international relations.---non
I'm really happy to see the connections with my primary education, like it was not useless for me.---int
Actually, I think that I have become a bit more disciplined.---int	
I really try to get some useful habits to set up my routine, like morning routine or some good habits for health, for, I don't know, studying and repetition.---non
Actually, continuing the last answer, it would be logical to say that it's important to do some small things every day to achieve success.---non
But actually, my real professional career and the process of getting my job position or what I'm doing right now is sometimes you need to be just in right place in right time.---non
Okay, actually, I suppose it's also connected to my professional work, professional position, because when I came first time in the company I'm currently working at, I was judged.---int
I came there with another major in university and my future boss wasn't expecting me to have more skills than it should be according to my first major.---non
But then they discovered that I'm a bit more skilled than they really expected.---non
And that's why I suppose I'm useful for them.---non
Actually, when I was in the first year of my Bachelor's degree, I was thinking about opening a bar with my friend, but I'm not really sure that it's a really good idea at the time.---non
But still, probably someday, maybe.---non	
Definitely not to open a bar, I suppose.---int	
Just working and probably getting PhD, continuing my education, but I'm not really sure if it's going to be one year or maybe two years, five years probably.---non
I don't really know actually because I really don't have some goals or plans coming to the top place when I'm working at now.---non
That's why I can't clearly see my future plans.---non
I just know that I suppose in a year I will change the company but I'm still not sure if I will change the whole direction I'm working at.---non
If I want to, maybe find a new profession, maybe I will still keep going in the same direction.---non
I'm not really sure about it.---non
Be distant and responsible, and quite careful with details.---non
But it's only about my position now.---ext
I'm not sure what qualities will be expected from me if I will move to higher positions to continue my career path.---ext
Some YouTube videos of school students who are showing how to use Excel and how I should correctly formulate the formulas to set up filters in the file.---non	
I suppose all of you mentioned before: kindness, empathy and humor, all of them create a good microclimate in the department.---ext	
That's really nice that I have all these characteristics in my own department and as a newcomer I feel quite comfortable with people I communicating now.---int	
The best way for me is communicating during some small breaks with a cup of tea and sweets or cakes.---int	
The most pleasurable time.---non
I'm quite sensitive to critics, frankly speaking.---ext
That's why when I got some comments from my senior colleagues, I just try to keep calm and memorize all they mentioned, making some notes and if it's possible for me to change I will change.---ext
I try not to give some strict comments myself because I suppose my position in the company is quite low, I just can give some suggestions to improve something, especially in my area.---int
Or discuss some sources to get some data for analysis and so on.---non	
But it's not really critical because all the work I will discuss, I will do personally, so like it's suggesting for myself.---int	
First, I've heard that I'm quite responsible and despite that my job interview was not really successful.---ext
My senior colleagues told me that they got me to work because of some analytical skills I have, hard skills are important.---ext
It depends on the type of task.---non
If a task requires some creativity, it's of course much better to do it in a format of brainstorming or generating ideas with the whole team.---ext
I really don't have many conflicts with co-workers now.---non
Because of the huge age gap between me and my co-workers it's difficult for me to clearly communicate with them, that's why I probably would like to run away from the conflict.---non
I suppose the power of new technologies.---non
Actually, despite everyone believing that it isn’t bad for them to have some soft style management, I personally prefer to work with some strict and maybe sometimes tough manager because they articulate their requirements quite clear.---int
You understand what you have to do and what they want from you.---non
Can I ask a question?---non
What means starting out?---non
I’m not sure.---non
Actually to be patient and not to be afraid of some small challenges or like cringey moments, they will happen anyway.---non
Yesterday, when I threw an unfinished table.---non
How does my decision-making process look like?---non
As for my personal decision-making process, it's like a small thought analysis in my head.---int	
I mean, comparing some advantages and disadvantages and based on them I just can make some decisions.---int
With the help of discipline.---non
Actually, it depends on people I communicate with, but now I'm mainly introvert because I am faced with a lot of new things in my daily life, like communication with new people.---non
That's why, that all makes me a bit more shy and confused.---non
Thank you, Albek.---non	
It’s a pleasure to speak with you.---non	
Oyu Tolgoi is a unique place to work because it blends traditional Mongolian values with the standards of an international company.---non
The mining industry plays a critical role in our economy, and we take great pride in our contribution.---non
At the same time, we’re encouraged to be proactive, share ideas, and continuously learn.---non	
This dynamic mix of tradition and modernity makes Oyu Tolgoi a unique and inspiring place to work at.---non
Hierarchy is important in Mongolia, but it’s not as rigid as people might think.---non
We respect our elders and those in higher positions, but we also value open communication and inclusiveness.---non
For example, junior employees are encouraged to observe and learn from experienced colleagues, but we’re also given chances to contribute ideas.---non
Decisions are often made through consensus, emphasizing harmony and mutual respect.---non
This approach helps.---non	
Absolutely, relationships are the backbone of our work culture.---non
We often strengthen bonds through shared meals, tea breaks, and social gatherings.---non	
Mongolian hospitality is deeply rooted in our culture, so inviting a colleague for a meal or tea is a way to show respect and build trust.---non
This personal connection makes collaboration smoother and more effective, as people are more willing to help and support each other.---non
Over time, this culture of mutual respect creates a sense of belonging and loyalty that extends beyond the workplace.---non
Strong leadership in Mongolia means being approachable, supportive, and respectful.---non
Leaders are expected to understand their team’s needs, motivate them, and lead by example.---non	
It’s common to see leaders participating in team activities, which helps break down hierarchies and fosters mutual respect.---non
Compared to more hierarchical cultures, Mongolian leaders often balance authority with humility and a personal touch.---non
This approach encourages employees to be proactive and take ownership of their work while feeling supported.---non
We take work-life balance very seriously at Oyu Tolgoi.---non
The company promotes flexible schedules, family support programs, and recreational activities to help employees recharge.---non
For those working on-site, a rotation system of 21 days on-site followed by 14 days off ensures adequate rest and quality time with family.---non
This system minimizes burnout and keeps morale high, which ultimately improves productivity.---non
The company also offers wellness programs, including mental health support and stress management workshops.---non

To address professional challenges, employees have access to continuous learning, leadership training, and career development opportunities.---non
This support system helps employees thrive in a demanding environment.---non
Mongolian work culture is distinctive in its emphasis on personal relationships, trust, and flexibility.---non
Unlike the more formal and hierarchical structure often seen in Russian work culture, Mongolian workplaces tend to be more informal, and communication flows more freely.---non	
Building trust is essential, and relationships often start with personal connections.---non
Mongolians value open dialogue, and decision-making often considers the input of the entire team.---non	
This collaborative and adaptive approach sets Mongolia apart from its neighbors.---non
Yes, one memorable moment was during a company event when a foreign manager tried Mongolian wrestling, a traditional sport.---non
Although he didn’t win, it was a great icebreaker, and everyone had a good laugh.---non
Events like these are common, where we celebrate traditional customs and bond as a team.---non	
These moments bring out the lighter side of work, helping us connect on a personal level.---non	
It’s amazing how cultural exchange can strengthen our work relationships.---non
Some people think Mongolians are reserved and hard to approach, but we are actually warm, friendly, and welcoming.---non
Building trust may take time, but once established, relationships are deep and genuine.---non
There’s also a misconception that Mongolia’s work environment is unstructured or lacks professionalism, which isn’t true.---non
We value hard work, integrity, and innovation, and the work environment is dynamic and focused on results.---non
Oyu Tolgoi is committed to supporting local communities through sustainable development.---non	
We invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects, often collaborating with local partners.---non

Learning a few basic Mongolian phrases can also create a good impression.---non
Embrace the experience—you’ll find Mongolia’s work culture rewarding and enriching.---non
My pleasure, Albek!---non
I’m glad to share Mongolian work culture with you.---non
It’s been great discussing how our traditions shape the way we work and live.---non
Okay.---non
Okay.---non
Okay.---non	
So my previous position is the call center operator, and I was on the outgoing calls.---non	
A computer assistant gave me the phone numbers with a short description of what was already agreed upon in the previous calls.---non
And then I would call people and either try to solve their problems or sell them something.---non	
I mean, selling was the main point.---non
It's the biggest phone and TV and network operator in my country---non	
They have call centers.---non
They do a lot of business with the government and when I was working there, there was a different section.---non
So I was on the outgoing calls.---non
We had different campaigns that we would have to do.---non
And then there were the incoming calls, I didn't work there because you need experience.---non
There was technical support where I also didn't work because I didn't have the qualifications.---non
In Slovenia.---non	
Yeah, there was a period, but I think it was really short.---non
It's government owned company, so the working standards are normal.---non
It was basically some sort of limited hours per week contract.---non
I didn't have really a lot of rights, so even the probation period didn't make sense because they could fire me at any time.---non
After one month I was just trained basically.---non
I could start maybe not even one month.---non
It was like two weeks and I was already making some simple phone calls and that's it basically.---non
I have a friend who was my coworker, but we were equals, but I relied on him for information.---ext	
But then I had direct managers.---non
There were actually two, and one of them was the de facto manager.---non
He was there for years and he knew everything, but he was just passed over for all the advancements, I dunno, career progression.---non
And then we had this boss, she was basically working under him.---non
And then because she has this bossy personality, she got upgraded into the boss.---non	
Officially, yeah.---non
If you have any kind of qualification, it quickly kills your brain because it's just, the challenge is not there.---non
So that was the challenge.---non	
The challenge was not even like the salary, but the lack of any kind of progression because you knew that there was this gap between the managerial positions and everyone else.---non
And then there was this leader of the whole call center.---non	
And above him there was the leader of all the call centers in the country.---non
This was regional or middle management, we didn't understand what they were doing.---non
For example, they demanded more time on call and less time doing other things.---non
But sometimes this couldn't be done because how do you call it?---non
Like if you wanna fill some documentation or something, this would destroy your statistics.---non
But doing documentation was also kind of expected and demanded of us.---non	
So the reports, you had to add these sales and make the sale, which would take like some time.---non
That would kill your statistics because then you would have like less time on call.---non
Because these bosses, they didn't know the reality of call centers.---non
They would see some sort of goals and they would try to improve the sales statistics and the productivity.---non	
But the result was that always like they found some sort of way to basically cheat at it.---non	
And hat was one thing.---non
This lack of career progress because you knew that the people who are the managers, they didn't start from the call center probably.---non
It's kind of pretty, I don't know, it was pretty bad.---non
And then maybe also some sort of like, yeah, I dunno like a lot of things, but not really important I guess.---non
There had been, because it's a state owned company, so you have a lot of these women that are like...---non
Yeah, then they are just there and they don't really care so much about doing a good job.---non	
Because their job is in no way threatened and they are protected under labor standards and they they just chill and sometimes they are rude, sometimes they are silly.---non
Managers?---non	
I don't know.---int	
For me it was weird that this guy that actually acted like he knew everything and all these weird details.---int	
Like yeah, 10 years ago we were moving the database from one system to the other and there is this bug in the system and you can lavoid it by doing this and that.---non
And it's one of these like one in 10,000 cases that he just knew because of his experience, but he was always friendly and like, kind of because of that.---non
And for me, this was kind of weird because I think he was a good manager and he really knew everything, but they didn't let him progress.---int
Like some other people did.---non
But I don't know, like maybe that was the weirdest part.---non	
But because  it's government owned, you have good protection rights, you get paid on time, they don't exploit you for extra hours because legally they can't.---non
So I dunno, goofy.---non
Yeah, they basically, I don't know, because of the unions, the standards were really high.---non
So if you are employed there, now the working conditions are really good, like judging from my ex-colleagues, salaries are high and uh, compensation and they have paid leave.---non
And a lot of leave, a lot of sick leave, a lot of everything, they offer you education, so on.---non
So yeah.---non	
Good.---non
Money.---non
I mean, simply because I wanted to save the money and I also knew that on the job market, if you don't have the qualifications, it's difficult.---non
So I think on the scale of these jobs that the students can do, it was a really good job because you had some sort of inducements.---int
Because you don't sell a lot of phones, but if you, I don't know, they adjusted them based on something in some months they were set unfairly basically.---non
Um, yeah.---non
But more or less the money and knowing that there are a lot of worse works, for example, this is relatively intellectual, you just have to like, you know, be friendly.---non
But for example, you could also work in some cafe and they wouldn't pay you.---non	
And this nightmare would be nightmarish.---non
I think that at this level there are no decisions per se.---int
Because for example, the decisions are like, sometimes there are some cases like for example the business or something and you just have to forward them because at this level, the business process is so streamlined that it is not your job, you forward to people who are responsible.---non
You don't really, it's more like lack of training.---non
As I was saying, these extreme cases of having to do something in some old database or something that someone would tell you, but no decisions.---non
These people, you just like kind of skipped them, although it was not really legal under the company's terms.---non
Yeah.---non
My usual morning days, it depends.---non
Usually I was working another job in the morning, then I would have some lunch and come in the afternoon.---non	
The good thing was that the lunch leave was paid.---non	
It's not like in Russia, you basically work nine hours, but it's eight hours.---non
I think they are friendly people, of course they are beautiful people.---int
I think even for their males also, they are friendly.---int
Sometimes you may see them and feel like, is this person really friendly?---non	
But really I think once you get to know them and you become a little bit friends with them, you know that they can do a lot of things for you.---non
Hello, my name is Deepak and I am a student of Masters in International Business Management.---non
I am from India and I have been also working here for a Russian company as a contract support executive.---non	
So yeah, whatever you need I am ready to help.---non
Thank you.---non
So, basically since I am from India, the company was looking some Indian to get their work done.---non
So, I applied to a lot of companies and then I got the interview and I successfully cleared the interview.---non
So, my work is basically like bridging a gap between my company and clients.---non
So, before having any equipment sold, we have a lot of documents work which we need to go through thoroughly one by one.---non	
So, lot of paperwork, documents, then there are a lot of clients, sometimes they get angry, but sometimes they don't get angry.---non
So, I need to convince them, sometimes on their behalf I need to explain something to the company.---non	
So yeah, it is a bit challenging and takes a lot of time and energy, but still I enjoy it.---int
So, it is a good job.---non	
Yeah, I love it because every time I need to consult with new people and every time when I consult with new people, it is a new experience.---int
Because everyone has a different way of working, perspective, dealing with things.---non	
So, every time I find something challenging and new to work or explore to learn something.---non
So, I love it.---int
The most I enjoy about my work is when I close the deal, when I get the satisfaction.---int	
You know, after months of work, when I am successfully able to complete everything, all the paperwork, this part is the most satisfying for me.---non
Okay, now I can close the file and I did something, I achieved something.---non
I managed to meet the demands of lot of people to make them agree on something.---non	
Then I feel like okay, I am doing something, I am achieving something.---int
So, my day typically starts at 8 and it takes around one hour for me to get to the office.---non
And then when I get to the office, I check my mail, if I have received some important mail first.---non
Then I will check them one by one and answer them in order to whatever documents are required.---non
If I need to schedule some meeting for tomorrow or something like this video meeting.---non
And then I will go to my regular part of the work, I will check my clients in order.---non 
So, yeah, hopefully I am satisfied with my work.---int	
I can do much more, but I am satisfied and I am constantly learning something new.---int
I think I take my work very seriously, whatever I do.---int
That's how I think of it.---int	
Secret to productivity.---non
It can be different.---non
In my opinion can differ from others.---int	
But the secret for productivity is to explain and make your brain or mind understand that there is no easy ways to progress.---int
So if your mind connects and picks that up it will push you to work hard and along with finding smart ways to do hard work.---int
So.---non	
But if you explain to your brain that it can be done, it will be done.---int
The leadership is autocratic.---non
1 dialect.---non	
Very hard.---non
Very hard, yes.---non
No.---non
Yes, but I think Democratic is better than that.---int
We had a manager before who was people oriented, so his leadership style was the best and he's really appreciated by everyone unless the one who is current who is very strict.---non
Yes, I have worked with diverse people.---non
So I have done some tasks where I had to do work with international people.---non	
So everyone is helpful and I have been fortunate enough to share experiences with them and share some time with them.---non
People oriented, like put your trust in me and I will produce result.---ext
Very quick learner, very quick.---non
No, like I just like provide me training and I want to do not stories or visual representation.---int
Just provide me to the point basic training and I will go for it.---non	
Professionally, it's like previous month I lost $2000.---non
I took a risk in business, in crypto business, I invested in some crypto coins and I lost value.---non
And then I got an experience that it is basically to rob poor people, poor people like us.---non	
The risk was not very good for me.---non
But thinking about it professionally in a business, if I would have invested in some stocks, I would have researched about it, whether to buy it or not.---non
Life is my career.---non		
I will advise him to just be patient and keep working hard, not find ways to cut corners or cut time just to get early at home or waste time.---non
So I would advise that be patient, work hard and it will produce results for you.---non	
Working smart because sometimes it can get you better results than your colleagues.---non
He has worked the same way as four others, but in the eyes of the manager or the owner this guy is attached to me and stuff.---non
Maybe produce an advantage or work smarter.---non
Find a short way to achieve that result in better time.---non
I don't stay organized.---non
Simple answer, like I say, very disorganized.---non
But in the office I stay organized because people are watching.---ext	
So the answer to the question is that if people are watching then I stay organized.---ext
Very big extrovert.---non	
It's because I am very emotionally expressive.---non
I make friends very easily.---non	
I'm a friendly type of person.---non
Anybody can talk to me about anybody and I enjoy learning about them and their lives, what is going on.---non
I try to learn from whatever mistakes they have made and try to attain positivities from them.---non
